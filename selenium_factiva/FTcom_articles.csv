Mondi, which is keen to increase its market position in the French corrugated packaging market, is offering E11.60 for each La Rochette share and up to E12.76 for the company's convertible bonds. The E11.6 price tag for La Rochette shares is an 18 per cent premium to the closing price of E9.8 on December 28. But shares in the group have risen in the past two weeks following interest from Saica, which bought a 22.5 per cent stake in the company for E63m on December 21. The shareprice was further inflated after Mondi bought a 22 per cent stake in the group on December 24. At the time Saica said it intended to discuss a full E280m takeover of the company with La Rochette's management. But the Spanish group ruled out paying more than E10.90 a share for the group, the price at which it bought its 22.5 per cent stake. It is thought that Mondi has already received acceptances from BNP Paribas, the French bank which holds a 23 per cent stake in La Rochette."

BHP took on 1.5 per cent to £20.74½ amid hopes it would restart its share buyback programme at interim results next month. The group suspended its buyback in late 2007, when it still had $4.2bn remaining to return to shareholders, to pursue its failed bid for Rio Tinto. UBS said BHP was in a strong position to restart the programme, forecasting the group would generate $7bn of surplus cash over the next 18 months. Releasing the $4.2bn currently set aside would only boost earnings per share by about 1 per cent, analyst Olivia Ker said. However, UBS also noted that BHP's Australian listing has been trading at a premium of 21 per cent to the UK shares. Management would likely target any buyback funds towards London to narrow this gap, it said. Sector peer Anglo American gained 3.2 per cent to £28.09 on the back of ""buy"" advice from Merrill Lynch. ""We believe that if management are not seen to be delivering both operationally and strategically by mid-late 2010, Xstrata could be back to bid again,"" Merrill told clients. The broker also raised its Anglo target price to £37.50 to reflect a rebound in platinum prices. A weaker dollar buoyed the rest of the miners, which helped lift the FTSE 100 by 39.02 points or 0.7 per cent to 5,494.39. Xstrata ended 2.4 per cent higher at £12.16½, while Rio took on 0.9 per cent at £36.15 and Kazakhmys rose 2.5 per cent to £14.45. ENRC was the biggest gainer, rising 3.9 per cent to £10.30 after Kazakhmys said it had no current plans to sell its 26 per cent stake but would look at other options. British Airways was up 1.1 per cent to 194¾p after Credit Suisse chose the airline as its preferred pick in a European sector note. ""BA is the carrier most leveraged to the recovery of the transatlantic market,"" it said. Lloyds Banking Group took on 3.2 per cent to 58½p amid renewed talk it could sell its insurance business to Resolution. Shares in Clive Cowdery's consolidation vehicle rose 1.9 per cent to 85¾p. International Power led the blue-chip fallers, down 3.4 per cent to 311p, on news its talks with GDF-Suez had collapsed. The shares had traded as high as 353½p in opening trade following reports that GDF was lining up a bid. However, it is thought the talks only related to a merger of assets outside their home markets which would have been funded by International Power stock. A fresh competition threat from BT Group weighed on BSkyB, with the telecoms group saying it will start a price war for sports coverage if the regulator cuts wholesale prices. BT was up 1.3 per cent to 147p. BSkyB lost 1.1 per cent to 567p, even though most analysts said the risk was negligible. BAE Systems slipped 0.9 per cent to 364¾p after Investec started coverage with a ""hold"" rating based on concerns about public spending. ""Sentiment will be the key driver in 2010, principally the defence market backdrop, with cuts probable, exacerbated in the UK by delays resulting from the general election and Strategic Defence Review,"" the broker said. Among the mid-caps, Logica was down 0.6 per cent to 123½p following a trade press report that it had botched a deal to supply case-management software at the UK Supreme Court. Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor called the reported failure a ""schoolboy error"" at a time when a change of government would likely result in deep cuts to state IT spending. Heritage Oil jumped 7.3 per cent to 524p after a statement from the Kurdish Regional Government boosted hopes its dispute with Iraq over oil revenue may be near a resolution. Vague rumours of M&A helped boost the engineering sector, with GKN moving up 1 per cent to 128½p. Rightmove edged 0.2 per cent lower to 528½p as markets shrugged off the launch of a competing website by estate agent Countrywide, formerly its biggest shareholder. 20100118_22975_441.xml"
"Factiva-20230329-1421.rtf","Document FTCOM00020040906e09500008","5 September 2004","FT.com site : Anglo American looks far afield.","1,255 words","In the tiny business district of Lusaka, a now empty wood-panelled office was once at the heart of Zambia's economy. For years, the executives here presided over one of the world's biggest copper producers. Today, the Anglo American Building houses the World Bank and several diplomatic missions. The shift came two years ago, when Tony Trahar, chief executive of Anglo American, the resources group, took the controversial decision to quit one of Zambia's biggest copper mining projects. In the eyes of the Zambian government, the company was turning its back on the revival of the copperbelt. But it marked a new unsentimental era for the recently London-listed company. Some South African politicians have expressed concern that the same fate may befall the group's similarly wood-panelled headquarters in Johannesburg's Main Street as Anglo American reshapes itself as a global resources company. It is the case that South Africa, where the original Anglo American Corporation was founded in 1917, now represents less than 30 per cent of Anglo American's earnings. But Mr Trahar, speaking at the company's London offices in St James, is sensitive to suggestions that Anglo American, a company that led South Africa's industrialisation, might lose its strong ties to its original home. A 56-year-old South African, Mr Trahar insists that there are good business reasons to stay. ""Johannesburg remains a cost-effective resource to us and it would be very costly to shift all of that to London,"" he explains. ""I think the South African political risk issue is starting to diminish - although I am not saying it has gone."" The strategic shift, which followed Anglo American's decision to move its primary listing in London five years ago, has enabled the company to diminish its dominant position on the South African stock market. It has sold its holdings in banks, insurers, finance and chemical companies that it amassed during theapartheid era. Its closest rivals - BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto - have also retained dual listings, the first in Australia and South Africa, the second in Australia and the UK. For all of Mr Trahar's warm words about his homeland, Anglo American's break with South Africa is having a significant impact on the company's corporate culture. Unlike Mr Trahar and his predecessors - Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Harry Oppenheimer and Ernest Oppenheimer, the founder of the company - future chief executives are unlikely to be one-company men. Mr Trahar, who joined 30 years ago, acknowledges this. ""I see my successor as a globally successful businessman, probably with experience in natural resources and hopefully an internal appointment."" Succession is not immediately on the agenda. Mr Trahar, who assumed control of the company four years ago, has another five years to serve before mandatory retirement. But already there are a number of executives emerging within the group as potential successors, including Simon Thompson, chief executive of Anglo American's base metals division. Also, the company's repositioning means that there are - and will be - fewer South Africans in senior positions. ""I think the executive management is probably still too South African-centric,"" he says. ""But I think that this is going to change progressively as well."" Already, the company's non-executive directors number a Dutchman, a Swede, a black South African and a Brazilian woman - making it more cosmopolitan than BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. But Anglo American's changing corporate culture is poised for further upheaval as Mr Trahar pursues his ambition to create a genuinely global resources company. The exit from Zambia was a landmark decision for a company closely associated with African development. But it was also symbolic of a new appetite to look to new markets - notably China. It is an irony that since the Zambian decision, copper prices have risen by two-thirds, a significant factor behind the 50 per cent rise in the company's half year profits announced last month. But China, with its huge demand for raw materials to fuel its fast-growing economy, is where Mr Trahar is focusing much of his attention. Anglo American has opened offices in China, where western-based resources groups still have relatively small operational interests. In China, it is looking for platinum and coal, in an effort to add to its cement bag manufacturing and small aggregates businesses. But Anglo American's main interest in China remains the supply of metals - coal, iron ore, copper and nickel - and forestry products from its operations spread across Africa, Australia, Europe and theAmericas. Also, a consumer spending boom has fuelled demand for diamonds and platinum. Indeed, demand in China for platinum jewellery accounted for 18 per cent of global platinum demand last year. Mr Trahar is optimistic about China remaining a key driver to the commodities demand boom. ""This is the big debate. Are we on the verge of a super commodities boom, or is this just a flash in the pan?"" he asks. ""Personally, I think we are on the threshold of a Japan in the 1960s, which had three decades of unparalleled growth. I am not saying that there won't be set-backs and slowdowns. But the potential for China to become like Japan - highly industrialised and highly productive - is a very exciting concept."" Anglo American, in its quest for global reach, has also opened offices in Russia. But Mr Trahar is unlikely to rush in with a cheque book to buy assets. ""Russia, like China, certainly has some difficulties. I think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's actions with Yukos have certainty rattled foreign investment sentiment,"" he says. Perhaps oddly, given the company's name, Mr Trahar's globalising plans do not appear to include the US - even though the recent settlement of a 10-year-old price-fixing charge against De Beers, the diamond group, paves the way for the diamond group to promote its brand in the world's largest diamond market. Unwinding the unpopular cross-shareholding between Anglo American and De Beers ranks as Mr Trahar's biggest achievement. It led to the delisting of De Beers, in which Anglo American now has a 45 per cent stake, from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The US government's anti-trust battle with De Beers had restricted Anglo American's business interests in the country until the restructuring deal. ""We did keep a low profile in the US while the De Beers case existed,"" says Mr Trahar. But actually, in terms of mining acquisitions, it is very difficult."" Even without the US in Anglo American's expanding empire, Mr Trahar has limited time to spend in any one place - even his native South Africa. Last year, the longest stretch he spent in any one place was 11 days. Anglo American has moved a long way from its African roots. But Mr Trahar does not rule out some kind of move back - even to Zambia. ""If there were attractive mining opportunities in Zambia we would go back there,"" he says. ""We are very comfortable operating in Africa."" TONY TRAHAR: GLOBAL ITINERARY ? Lives in London and Johannesburg ? Drives himself to work ? Travels on scheduled flights ?

On the plus side, Safeway was pushed to the forefront of the 100 index, its shares extending their excellent run, and driving towards their best level since mid-November. They finished the day 7 firmer at 307p The latest surge in Safeway shares came in the wake of the company's Christmas trading update, which showed like for like sales up 5.9 per cent in the 12 weeks to January 6, news that was well-received in the market. Somerfield, the smallest of the supermarket groups, did not prove a disappointment either, its shares topping the FTSE 250 performance table after better-than-expected interim numbers which showed the company had begun to regain some of the sales lost in the early part of its first half trading period. Somerfield shares closed a net 43/4 higher at 93p, after 97p, their best level since the end of 1999. Kingfisher took the wooden spoon in the FTSE 100, its shares sliding rapidly to close 48, or almost 10 per cent, down at 442p after disappointing the market with its latest trading news. Its like-for-like sales for the nine weeks to December 30 rose 4.5 per cent, but came from low margin areas. Dealers said news that UBS Warburg, Kingfisher's own broker, had cut its earnings forecasts for the group's current year by just over 5 per cent to GBP600m because of margin pressures, prompted a flurry of selling of Kingfisher stock. Other brokers were quick to follow and there was talk that downgrades extended much further than Warburg's reduction. Meanwhile Matalan, the discount stores group and one of the fastest rising stars in the stock market during the past couple of years, continued its dramatic fall from grace. The shares fell a further 38l to 403lp after hitting 399lp at one point. That closing level was 44 per cent down on last Thursday's 727p. Boots gave an initial positive response to its trading update, which showed sales only marginally lower over the Christmas period, but they quickly succumbed to the general malaise affecting the retailers, sliding back to 535p before rallying to finish 4 up at 553p. Debenhams was the star of the second ranking general retailers, ending the day 9 up at 313p, their best level since autumn 1999, after a near-6 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the 20 weeks to January 13. With the FTSE 100 down, one of the biggest fallers was ARM partly in response to the note issued by UBS Warburg which took a generally negative and defensive stance on the tech sector. ARM, which is vulnerable to downturns in mobile phone sales was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"". Following the announcement, the shares fell 41 to 508p. Nycomed Amersham led the pharmaceuticals sector and the Footsie with a rise of 14l to 520p as brokers continued to re-rate the company's prospects. Lehman Brothers moved its recommendation on the medical systems group to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"". The shift followed support from HSBC, which has upgraded it to ""buy"" from ""add"" and set a 645p price target. GlaxoSmithKline ran ahead 70 at best but closed only 5 better at GBP17.95. Goldman Sachs formally initiated coverage of the merged company with a ""market outperform"" rating and GBP20.50 target. On the other hand, the macro-economics team at Merrill Lynch reduced pharmaceuticals to ""underweight"" given their high valuations. Barclays gained 52 to GBP21.45 after brokers responded enthusiastically to news of the groups' strategic alliance with Legal & General. The two groups announced a deal which enables Barclays to sell L&G life, pension and investment products throughout the UK. Merrill Lynch recommended Barclays as a ""buy"" and L&G as ""accumulate"". L&G were up earlier but fell back to close 7 off at 169p Abbey National fell 31 to GBP12.04 after HSBC downgraded the mortgage bank to ""add"" from ""buy"", highlighting the risk/reward factor associated with the current bid situation surrounding the group. The oil majors tracked back ahead of Wednesday's Opec meeting which is widely expected to announce a big production cut. With any shift from the oil cartel already factored into prices, BP Amoco fell 13l to 557p and Shell Transport 14l to 552p. However Credit Lyonnais Securities lifted its oil price target to $26 a barrel from $21 and said the sector was 40 per cent undervalued. A tobacco industry court win in the US yesterday came too late to prevent BAT Industries falling 101/4 to 4791/4p. However, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter felt it was sufficiently significant to reiterate its ""outperform"" stance and 550p target while Merrill Lynch stressed its ""overweight"" stance on the sector. EMI was heavily traded and fell 29 to 533p on turnover of almost 30m after Deutsche Bank placed 12.5m shares at 540p a share. However there was support from HMV, which is 43 per cent owned by EMI. The book and music seller said in a trading statement that it grew like-for-like sales by 8 per cent over the Christmas period. Stockbroker Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein was the catalyst for the outstanding performance of National Express, the trains, tram, bus, coach and airport services group whose shares ran up 34l to 851lp, elevating the shares to the top five FTSE 250 performers. DKW upped its recommendation on National Express to ""buy"" from ""add"", pointing to the success of its cost-cutting programme. The takeover tussles in the construction sector left those involved mostly steady. Taylor Woodrow crept up a penny to 172p on news of its offer for rival Bryant, which is currently engaged in merger talks with Beazer. Persimmon, which initiated moves for Beazer, was down 5l at 263p. Bryant edged up 186p and Beazer hardened to 174lp. Allied Domecq was the biggest mover in the drinks sector, sliding 121/4 to 417p, as a Spanish newspaper claimed Allied was hoping to buy a Spanish wine producer."

However, the lead-up to Christmas was rosier for Debenhams, the department store group, which said total sales rose 10.8 per cent in the 20 weeks to January 13, with like-for-like sales up 5.9 per cent and gross margins maintained at last year's levels. The Boots group's overall retail sales fell 1.3 per cent in the 13 weeks to the end of December, compared with a 1.5 per cent decline in like-for-like sales. The drop was driven by a 5 per cent decline in Boots the Chemists' exit from leisure merchandise, although there was a good increase in margins, Steve Russell, the chief executive, said. On a quarterly basis, the group's overall retail sales fell 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.9 per cent fall in like-for-like sales. Boots the Chemists' total sales fell 2.0 per cent in the period, and like-for-like sales recorded the same decrease. Health and beauty sales increased by 3.6 per cent in the 13 weeks, with like-for-like sales up 2.1 per cent despite a much lower incidence of colds and flu in the latest period, with over-the-counter medicine sales falling 8.3 per cent. In Boots's health and beauty services division, 16 new dental care practices and 13 new chiropody practices opened between August and the end of December. Dental care grew 117.1 per cent in the 13-week period, more than doubling the like-for-like increase of 51.3 per cent, while chiropody and footcare services were up 108.2 per cent, compared with like-for-like sales up 62.9 per cent. Boots the Opticians grew 0.8 per cent in the period, with like-for-like sales up 1.2 per cent. Despite a weak market, sales were helped by the roll-out of Advanced Lightstream Technology and an overall improvement in sales per eye examination, Mr Russell said. In Boots' international retail division, sales in Thailand were up 29.7 per cent in the period but like-for-like sales fell 13.0 per cent in a climate of political and economic uncertainty, he said. In Japan, sales increased by 87.6 per cent in the period, or 1.4 per cent in like-for-like sales. The recently-opened stores in Taiwan performed well. The Debenhams group achieved record sales in the final weeks before Christmas, with particularly strong performance in clothing and gifts, Debenhams said in its trading statement. In the six weeks to December 24, like-for-like sales were up 7.0 per cent from the previous year. The sale which began on December 27 was affected by extreme weather but sales improved over the last 12 days of the period. During the first half of the financial year, Debenhams opened four new stores and will open another store in Uxbridge in March. These stores are expected to contribute about 4.5 per cent to total sales in the financial year. ""We are progressing with our strategic investments, designed to drive future sales, in our new and modernised stores, together with the internet and home shopping catalogue. We have also increased the level of investment in customer service and our premium advertising campaign,"" Peter Jarvis, the chairman of Debenhams, said. Boots shares were up 4p at 553p on Tuesday with Debenhams up 9p at 313p."

PARIS focused on Schneider and Legrand, the electrical equipment makers, following Monday's announcement of a friendly merger between the pair. Shares in both companies were halted limit-down when trading resumed on Tuesday and were due to requote later in the session. TotalFinaElf was the biggest faller among French blue chips as the oil sector across Europe ran into profit-taking after several days of gains.

On the plus side, Safeway was pushed to the forefront of the 100 index, its shares extending their excellent run, and driving towards their best level since mid-November. They finished the day 7 firmer at 307p The latest surge in Safeway shares came in the wake of the company's Christmas trading update, which showed like for like sales up 5.9 per cent in the 12 weeks to January 6, news that was well-received in the market. Somerfield, the smallest of the supermarket groups, did not prove a disappointment either, its shares topping the FTSE 250 performance table after better-than-expected interim numbers which showed the company had begun to regain some of the sales lost in the early part of its first half trading period. Somerfield shares closed a net 43/4 higher at 93p, after 97p, their best level since the end of 1999. Kingfisher took the wooden spoon in the FTSE 100, its shares sliding rapidly to close 48, or almost 10 per cent, down at 442p after disappointing the market with its latest trading news. Its like-for-like sales for the nine weeks to December 30 rose 4.5 per cent, but came from low margin areas. Dealers said news that UBS Warburg, Kingfisher's own broker, had cut its earnings forecasts for the group's current year by just over 5 per cent to GBP600m because of margin pressures, prompted a flurry of selling of Kingfisher stock. Other brokers were quick to follow and there was talk that downgrades extended much further than Warburg's reduction. Meanwhile Matalan, the discount stores group and one of the fastest rising stars in the stock market during the past couple of years, continued its dramatic fall from grace. The shares fell a further 38l to 403lp after hitting 399lp at one point. That closing level was 44 per cent down on last Thursday's 727p. Boots gave an initial positive response to its trading update, which showed sales only marginally lower over the Christmas period, but they quickly succumbed to the general malaise affecting the retailers, sliding back to 535p before rallying to finish 4 up at 553p. Debenhams was the star of the second ranking general retailers, ending the day 9 up at 313p, their best level since autumn 1999, after a near-6 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the 20 weeks to January 13. With the FTSE 100 down, one of the biggest fallers was ARM partly in response to the note issued by UBS Warburg which took a generally negative and defensive stance on the tech sector. ARM, which is vulnerable to downturns in mobile phone sales was cut from ""buy"" to ""hold"". Following the announcement, the shares fell 41 to 508p. Nycomed Amersham led the pharmaceuticals sector and the Footsie with a rise of 14l to 520p as brokers continued to re-rate the company's prospects. Lehman Brothers moved its recommendation on the medical systems group to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"". The shift followed support from HSBC, which has upgraded it to ""buy"" from ""add"" and set a 645p price target. GlaxoSmithKline ran ahead 70 at best but closed only 5 better at GBP17.95. Goldman Sachs formally initiated coverage of the merged company with a ""market outperform"" rating and GBP20.50 target. On the other hand, the macro-economics team at Merrill Lynch reduced pharmaceuticals to ""underweight"" given their high valuations. Barclays gained 52 to GBP21.45 after brokers responded enthusiastically to news of the groups' strategic alliance with Legal &General. The two groups announced a deal which enables Barclays to sell L&G life, pension and investment products throughout the UK. Merrill Lynch recommended Barclays as a ""buy"" and L&G as ""accumulate"". L&G were up earlier but fell back to close 7 off at 169p Abbey National fell 31 to GBP12.04 after HSBC downgraded the mortgage bank to ""add"" from ""buy"", highlighting the risk/reward factor associated with the current bid situation surrounding the group. The oil majors tracked back ahead of Wednesday's Opec meeting which is widely expected to announce a big production cut. With any shift from the oil cartel already factored into prices, BP Amoco fell 13l to 557p and Shell Transport 14l to 552p. However Credit Lyonnais Securities lifted its oil price target to $26 a barrel from $21 and said the sector was 40 per cent undervalued. A tobacco industry court win in the US yesterday came too late to prevent BAT Industries falling 101/4 to 4791/4p. However, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter felt it was sufficiently significant to reiterate its ""outperform"" stance and 550p target while Merrill Lynch stressed its ""overweight"" stance on the sector. EMI was heavily traded and fell 29 to 533p on turnover of almost 30m after Deutsche Bank placed 12.5m shares at 540p a share. However there was support from HMV, which is 43 per cent owned by EMI. The book and music seller said in a trading statement that it grew like-for-like sales by 8 per cent over the Christmas period. Stockbroker Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein was the catalyst for the outstanding performance of National Express, the trains, tram, bus, coach and airport services group whose shares ran up 34l to 851lp, elevating the shares to the top five FTSE 250 performers. DKW upped its recommendation on National Express to ""buy"" from ""add"", pointing to the success of its cost-cutting programme. The takeover tussles in the construction sector left those involved mostly steady. Taylor Woodrow crept up a penny to 172p on news of its offer for rival Bryant, which is currently engaged in merger talks with Beazer. Persimmon, which initiated moves for Beazer, was down 5l at 263p. Bryant edged up 186p and Beazer hardened to 174lp. Allied Domecq was the biggest mover in the drinks sector, sliding 121/4 to 417p, as a Spanish newspaper claimed Allied was hoping to buy a Spanish wine producer."

CL has increased its crude price target by $5 a barrel to $26. Pharmaceutical shares were firm in London. Nycomed Amersham, which recently won a court victory over diagnostic patents in the US, was lifted from neutral to outperform at Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs had a similar positive stance on GlaxoSmithKline. British Telecom is trying to increase internet usage in the UK by offering completely free access until mid-2001 through its new chain of 600 internet kiosks. They are located in retail and transport locations and contain a colour touchscreen for immediate web connections. BT shares underperformed on Tuesday on continued worries about its financial position. Its debts have risen by a further E11bn following its purchase of another 45 per cent in Viag Interkom of Germany from E.ON under an option agreement. The news encouraged speculators who believe that E.ON may use the cash to help finance a bid for Powergen. There were sharp contrasts in analysts' reactions to the latest updates on retail activity in the UK during December and early January. SG Securities was among several brokers favouring Debenhams with a buy rating while it put a strong buy stance on Boots. Sales at Boots were down 2 per cent in the three months to December but this reflected the elimination of low-margin items. While Boots was thus able to point to better profits from smaller sales, Kingfisher was badly undermined by anxieties over lower margins on rising turnover. WestLB Panmure was among brokers recommending a sell on Kingfisher while SG Securities cut its estimate of pre-tax profits for the full year by GBP35m to GBP600m. Deutsche Bank raised ThyssenKrupp in Frankfurt from market performer to buy in response to an unexpectedly reassuring annual forecast from the steel and engineering group on Monday. Semiconductor innovators were weak in London following a downgrade on their prospects from UBS Warburg.

"Factiva-20230329-1433 (1).rtf","Document ftcom00020010715dx1g00a8n","16 January 2001","Smart moves for the long haul.","1,014 words","Last week, Ashford Hospital in Middlesex, the nearest hospital to Heathrow Airport, reported that an average of one person a month had died over the past three years as a result of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after flying into Heathrow. The news, following some well publicised DVT-related deaths of passengers coming off long-haul flights, renewed simmering concern about the dangers of air travel. DVT occurs when the flow of blood in the veins of the leg is so restricted that a clot forms and attaches itself to the vein wall. According to Dr Patrick Kesteven, consultant haematologist at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, small, asymptomatic clots form fairly regularly in the veins of healthy people but quickly dissolve again when blood flow resumes. Problems occur when the clot does not dissolve, becomes detached from the vein wall and travels through the bloodstream until it comes to a capillary it cannot pass through. Often this blocks a pulmonary artery, causing serious illness or death. Although the chances of dying from ""travellers' thrombosis"", as the syndrome has become known, are slim - 12 DVT-related deaths out of the 31m passengers who fly into Heathrow airport every year makes a risk factor of one in 2.5m - doctors are advising travellers to take certain precautions, particularly if they are likely to be sitting in the same seat for 12 hours or more. Assess your risk ""There are two types of people when it comes to DVT,"" says Peter Bell, professor of surgery at the University of Leicester, ""those who show risk factors and the rest."" You are more at risk from DVT if you or someone in your family has a previous history of DVT; if you have had treatment for cancer; if you are taking the contraceptive pill or are on hormone replacement therapy; if you have serious varicose veins; if you are overweight or unusually tall or short. ""If you fall into a risk group,"" says Professor Bell, ""you should still be able to fly but you should check with your GP first."" Do this ahead of time. Although all big inter-national airports have emergency medical facilities, few, and none in Britain, have walk-in doctors' surgeries for passengers. Take an aspirinAspirin helps thin the blood, so, unless you have an aspirin allergy or suffer from stomach ulcers or serious indigestion - which aspirin will aggravate - take a single child's dose (75mg) 24 hours before you fly, another one on the day of your flight and one the day after that. Alternatives to aspirin, says Professor Edzard Ernst of the department of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, include willow bark, which has a similar action to aspirin; ginkgo biloba, which can reduce blood clotting; and garlic. Go for a run Before the flight, a jog or a swim will improve circulation. Once on board, walk aroundDVT has been associated with long-haul flights because of the length of time people sit in one position when they are in the air. In everyday life, the calf muscles massage the veins in the leg as you walk around, keeping the blood flowing. Sitting still reduces this action, slowing blood flow and increasing the chances of clotting. Worse, according to Dr Kesteven, is sitting with bent knees, which ""creases up the veins at the back of the knee, slowing the blood flow"". To avoid this, do not cross your legs. You should also leave your seat and walk around once every hour or so. This helps the calf muscles to get the blood moving again. (Walking around also helps avoid swollen feet, caused by the same slowing of the blood flow up the veins in the leg.) While in your seat, flex each foot, as if you were pressing down on the accelerator in a car. Many airlines, including British Airways, carry information about these exercises in the in-flight magazine or video service. Store your hand luggage in the overhead lockers This lets you stretch your legs out in front of you. Wear loose clothingAvoid tight socks or stockings that restrict the flow of blood. Some doctors recommend support tights or compression bandages - but beware. When fitted properly, these are excellent for helping the blood flow up the veins in the leg - but if they become crumpled-up they can restrict blood flow further and make matters worse. Boots, the chemist, sells compression bandages on prescription only and advises travellers to see their GP first to be sure of using the right type and fit. The company says support stockings, which provide less compression, are on sale at many of its branches, though not necessarily at airports, where they have less stock. Alcohol, air and tobacco There is no conclusive link between drinking alcohol and DVT but Prof Bell recommends drinking water alongside your gin and tonic. Aircraft cabins are pressurised to the equivalent of 6,000ft and, as Dr Kesteven points out: ""A large proportion of the world's population live at that altitude without contracting DVT."" Cabin air has slightly less oxygen than air at sea level but there is no known link between this and DVT. Smoking can increase the concentration of red cells in the bloodstream, thereby raising its viscosity and reducing the speed of flow, but there is no demonstrable link between smoking and DVT. At the very least you may want to skip that last cigarette before you board the plane. Class does not matterIn terms of DVT risk, travelling business class or economy seems to make no difference, although it is certainly easier to stroll around a business class cabin than an economy one. Nor, in fact, does the type of transport you use - sitting still is sitting still. Lord Winston, commenting on the House of Lords' report on air travel and health, published last November, said: ""We also accept that flying is not the only risk. If you are travelling by coach to Carlisle you are at exactly the same kind of risk."""

The annual rate of underlying inflation in the UK fell to 2.0 per cent last month from 2.2 per cent in November, a bigger drop than analysts had expected. That made it 22 months in a row that inflation remained below the governments target level of 2.5 per cent. The figures supported the view that a cut in interest rates at the next meeting of the Bank of Englands monetary policy committee was likely. However, a near-term policy easing now appears to have been largely factored in by the market. The telecoms sector had the biggest negative impact on the market. Vodafone Group, Londons biggest stock by market capitalisation, was down 3.6 per cent, while British Telecommunications was off 3.8 per cent and Colt Telecom was 6.3 per cent lower. Heavily-weighted oil stocks also weighed the market down as investors booked profits after the sector's recent strong run. BP Amoco was down 1.3 per cent and Shell Transport was 2.5 per cent lower. GlaxoSmithKline offered some support as it rose 2.4 per cent after Goldman Sachs provided some positive comments about the stock. Retailers were mixed.

The Office of Fair Trading, which launched the case in the Restrictive Practices Court, said the Community Pharmacy Action Group (CPAG) gave up the fight when the presiding judge indicated last Friday that they were unlikely to win. The CPAG said Tuesday's events were a ""devastating blow"" to the country's community pharmacies. Boots, which runs a chain of 1,400 chemists and is a member of the CPAG, described the outcome as disappointing. Company shares were down 7 per cent at 573-1/2p in late-afternoon trading in London. John Vickers, OFT director general, said: ""This is excellent news for consumers who will now benefit from lower and more competitive prices for common household medicines. Consumers will save many millions of pounds a year"". The court immediately repealed the 30-year-old price fixing system, which has allowed manufacturers to recommend minimum prices for over-the-counter medications including vitamins, cough medicines and paracetemol. The OFT launched the case after a three-year investigation into resale price maintenance. The RPM system was adopted in 1970 when the courts found that competition from supermarkets would accelerate the decline of local chemists. The court began hearing the case for the second time last month after an earlier trial was abandoned when a member of the panel hearing the evidence resigned due to a potential conflict of interest. Supermarkets Asda, owned by Wal-Mart of the US, and Tesco were expected to immediately launch a price-cutting campaign."

BTC has so far succeeded admirably - lifting the operating margin 0.8 points to 13.2 per cent last year. But the issue is increasingly pressing. The 1,400-store BTC, supplying 85 per cent of group operating profits - before charges for new initiatives - can no longer be described as anything but mature. Own-label products accounting for 40 per cent of turnover have cushioned it against competition. But grocers' incursions on to Boots' territory - with price-fixing on non-prescription medicines recently removed - are ever more frequent and wide-ranging. Initiatives such as putting dentists and physiotherapists into shops may perk up underperforming space, but look unlikely to fuel significant growth. And Boots was late to develop alternative revenue streams. It is now pouring money into doing so - an upmarket beauty chain, international expansion in Asia and internet shopping. But there are no indications of when these will generate returns. The cost savings underpinning recent profits growth - a cumulative annual GBP250m by 2002 - cannot continue indefinitely. The market is already talking of more drastic ways of releasing value - demerging Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs maker, and selling property. If directors do not start thinking radically, with the shares on a lowly 12 times prospective earnings, they risk a predator doing so for them."

The company will initially open eight ""Pure Beauty"" stores, the first in London's Covent Garden in September. But it sees room for a total of 65 stores in large urban centres stocking high end cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products, vitamins and beauty accessories. Boots hopes its new retail concept will increase its share of the GBP3bn ($4.3bn) cosmetics market by 5 per cent. The announcement came as the company reported a rise in pre-tax profit before exceptionals to GBP581.1m from GBP570.8m in the year ended March 31, in line with expectations of GBP550m-GBP590m. After exceptionals, the pre-tax line dropped to GBP492.2m on turnover almost flat at GBP5.22bn compared with GBP5.19bn previously. In the past, Boots has been criticised by analysts for adding costs into the exceptionals line that some believed were simply part of doing business. Last November, the group announced a GBP100m cost-cutting drive which is due to be completed by next March. Boots will eliminate more than 1,000 jobs, mainly from the chemists chain, and focus the business on health and beauty. Sales at the core Boots The Chemist chain rose 0.3 per cent but fell 0.2 per cent on a like-for-like basis as the group continued its managed exit from non-core leisure ranges including CDs, cookware and home brewing kits. As the sales mix changed, however, overall gross margins strengthened by 0.5 per cent. Steve Russell, chief executive, said he was confident the health and beauty sales would move ahead and margin improvement would continue. ""We are confident of the outcome for the year and expect that the pattern of profit improvement will favour the second half,"" he said."" Boots warned earlier this month that the abolition of price fixing on over-the-counter drugs would reduce profits by about GBP15m-GBP20m per year over the next 18 months to two years. Boots Healthcare International, the subsidiary that makes OTC treatments including Nurofen and Strepsils, turned in a strong performance last year. Lifted by the Clearasil acquisition, sales rose 13 per cent to GBP362m. The picture was less rosy at Halfords, the car and bike accessory chain, which saw operating profit fall 18.1 per cent to GBP37m. The international retail division, which is focused in south east Asia, also had a poor year, with operating losses widening to GBP43.9m from GBP33.1m. Rowan Morgan, analyst at Teather &Greenwood, was impressed by the full-year figures and said he believes that Boots' shares, last down 9p at 5713/4p, are good value. ""These results should provide some consolation to the market,"" he said. ""Not only are they in line but there are no nasty surprises and some of the rumour going around the market will be dispelled."" Earnings per share were 37.9p against 45p.

The Cubic Expression Company said it had bought 9.8m United shares late last week, bringing the total to 17.6m, a large proportion of which were apparently bought off market. United issued a 212 notice, a device used by companies to trace shareholders, but appeared as much in the dark as analysts. Cubic, initially believed to be registered in the British Virgin Islands, was eventually traced to a nominee list account at the Bank of New York. Attempts by Man Utd and its broker Merill Lynch to identify who was behind the vehicle drew a blank. Trading floors were awash with rumours. One theory centred on Dermot Desmond, the Irish financier, while other reports favoured a mysterious consortium of buyers from East Asia, a region where the team has a large following or even members of ""the Arab horse racing fraternity"". One bemused analyst said: ""There's all sorts of rumour and speculation going on with the share price at its current levels. Sometimes it's media companies, and sometimes it's consortiums. But it's not outside the realms of possibility that a rich individual would want to buy it."" After the market closed the mystery buyers revealed themselves to be Irish investors JP McManus and John Magnier. A spokesman for the company said the shareholding was purely an investment. Meanwhile, oil stocks were under heavy pressure amid fears of a fall in demand for oil and sliding oil prices. The market was surprised by weekly inventory figures from the American Petroleum Institute, which revealed a rise of more than 5.6m barrels of oil stocks. Many had been expecting a decrease of between 500,000 and 1m barrels. Index heavyweight BP fell 19 to 547p on the news, and shares in Shell lost 22l at 553p. Volume was very heavy, with more than 76m shares traded in BP and nearly 48m in Shell. The net effect was to drag the FTSE 100 down by more than 27 points. Shares in oil companies throughout continental Europe were ruffled by the news despite reports that Saudi Arabia thinks Opec could cut production of oil at or before its September meeting. ""The very strong oil price in recent months was never going to be sustainable. The fact that the price is dropping is all part of a natural correction process"" said Steve Turner, oils analyst at Commerzbank. Royal Bank of Scotland shares appeared to absorb successfully the placing of around GBP2bn worth of shares in the group on Tuesday. The placing came after the bank said it would buy the retail bank of Mellon Financial of the US. The shares closed up 29 at GBP15.09, having fallen sharply on Tuesday. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein reiterated its buy recommendation on the group, advising investors ""not to focus solely on the short term merits of this deal but instead the strength of underling growth and the undemanding valuation of the stock"". Goldman Sachs was less upbeat. It said: ""the purchase of assets in the US is a strategic coup but adds only a little value for shareholders."" It gave RBS a retained market performer rating. Volume in RBS was predictably heavy, with more than 47m shares traded in the group as Banco Santander moved into the market to maintain its 9 per cent weighting following the dilution from the placing. The telecoms turmoil moved on to Telewest Communications, whose shares fell to their lowest point for three years, down 93/4 to 623/4p. The spotlight moved on to the debt levels brought about by the cable company's build-up costs. ""The position is quite grim,"" said one analyst, adding that it was always going to be some time before Telewest swung into profit, but serious concerns had started to come about in the past few days. The company was pulled down by an overnight fall on the Nasdaq Composite by rival NTL, following speculation that the latter faced a crunch as its bond yields rose sharply. Telewest was also hit by fears about the debt levels of United Pan-Europe Communications, the Dutch cable company. Colt Telecom and Energis, both big losers on Tuesday, recovered 16l to 322lp and 11 to 166p. Nigel Hawkins, telecoms analyst at Williams de Broe, said the market would be eagerly awaiting news from Colt on funding and trading issues at their next set of results, or preferably sooner. Marconi closed 3/4 lower at 99p, after an eventful annual general meeting, where some irate investors called for the heads of the board. The telecommunications equipment manufacturer defended itself on the handling of the recent profits warning, as well as its decision to go into the telecoms market when it did. Also attracting attention was the annual meeting of BT, which rose 21/4 to 479p. Its statement touched on operating performance and attempts to cut debt, but analysts said there were no great surprises. ARM Holdings, the micro-chip designer, was down 1/4 at 210lp, despite downbeat news from Intel in the US. Goldman Sachs reiterated its market outperformer rating on the stock. Logica fell 15 to 615p. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded the IT services company from add to a buy with a price target of 800p. FKI, the engineering group, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, sliding 55 to 192p, after it said that half-year operating profit would be 15 per cent lower than last year. Boots rose 8 to 638p after the health and beauty retailer gave further details of its planned collaboration with J. Sainsbury. Sainsbury closed up 1l at 431p. Mining companies were hit by the weakness in the price of palladium and platinum. Anglo American lost 55 at 975p, the second biggest blue-chip faller. Rio Tinto was also lower, off 26 at GBP12.25 and BHP Billiton shed 7 at 345p."

The stores would vary in size from 2,800 to 4,200 sq ft and include a pharmacy staffed by Boots employees and consultants. If the trial goes well, the agreement could be extended to include other Sainsbury's superstores. ""This link brings together two well-established and highly respected quality brands to provide an unrivalled food, health and beauty offering in the UK,"" said Sir Peter Davis, Sainsbury's chief executive. The venture would help Sainsbury's recapture some of the ground lost to rival Tesco in recent years, and give Boots access to the increasing number of customers choosing to shop away from town centres. News of the tie-up is bound to spark further rumours of a multi-billion pound merger between Boots and Sainsbury's. But the companies has so far denied plans of a full-blown merger and analysts are sceptical that two such different corporate cultures could ever successfully be united."

The Cubic Expression Company said it had bought 9.8m United shares late last week, bringing the total to 17.6m, a large proportion of which were apparently bought off market. United issued a 212 notice, a device used by companies to trace shareholders, but appeared as much in the dark as analysts. Cubic, initially believed to be registered in the British Virgin Islands, was eventually traced to a nominee list account at the Bank of New York. Attempts by Man Utd and its broker Merill Lynch to identify who was behind the vehicle drew a blank. Trading floors were awash with rumours. One theory centred on Dermot Desmond, the Irish financier, while other reports favoured a mysterious consortium of buyers from East Asia, a region where the team has a large following or even members of ""the Arab horse racing fraternity"". One bemused analyst said: ""There's all sorts of rumour and speculation going on with the share price at its current levels. Sometimes it's media companies, and sometimes it's consortiums. But it's not outside the realms of possibility that a rich individual would want to buy it."" After the market closed the mystery buyers revealed themselves to be Irish investors JP McManus and John Magnier. A spokesman for the company said the shareholding was purely an investment. Meanwhile, oil stocks were under heavy pressure amid fears of a fall in demand for oil and sliding oil prices. The market was surprised by weekly inventory figures from the American Petroleum Institute, which revealed a rise of more than 5.6m barrels of oil stocks. Many had been expecting a decrease of between 500,000 and 1m barrels. Index heavyweight BP fell 19 to 547p on the news, and shares in Shell lost 22l at 553p. Volume was very heavy, with more than 76m shares traded in BP and nearly 48m in Shell. The net effect was to drag the FTSE 100 down by more than 27 points. Shares in oil companies throughout continental Europe were ruffled by the news despite reports that Saudi Arabia thinks Opec could cut production of oil at or before its September meeting. ""The very strong oil price in recent months was never going to be sustainable. The fact that the price is dropping is all part of a natural correction process"" said Steve Turner, oils analyst at Commerzbank. Royal Bank of Scotland shares appeared to absorb successfully the placing of around GBP2bn worth of shares in the group on Tuesday. The placing came after the bank said it would buy the retail bank of Mellon Financial of the US. The shares closed up 29 at GBP15.09, having fallen sharply on Tuesday. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein reiterated its buy recommendation on the group, advising investors ""not to focus solely on the short term merits of this deal but instead the strength of underling growth and the undemanding valuation of the stock"". Goldman Sachs was less upbeat. It said: ""the purchase of assets in the US is a strategic coup but adds only a little value for shareholders."" It gave RBS a retained market performer rating. Volume in RBS was predictably heavy, with more than 47m shares traded in the group as Banco Santander moved into the market to maintain its 9 per cent weighting following the dilution from the placing. The telecoms turmoil moved on to Telewest Communications, whose shares fell to their lowest point for three years, down 93/4 to 623/4p. The spotlight moved on to the debt levels brought about by the cable company's build-up costs. ""The position is quite grim,"" said one analyst, adding that it was always going to be some time before Telewest swung into profit, but serious concerns had started to come about in the past few days. The company was pulled down by an overnight fall on the Nasdaq Composite by rival NTL, following speculation that the latter faced a crunch as its bond yields rose sharply. Telewest was also hit by fears about the debt levels of United Pan-Europe Communications, the Dutch cable company. Colt Telecom and Energis, both big losers on Tuesday, recovered 16l to 322lp and 11 to 166p. Nigel Hawkins, telecoms analyst at Williams de Broe, said the market would be eagerly awaiting news from Colt on funding and trading issues at their next set of results, or preferably sooner. Marconi closed 3/4 lower at 99p, after an eventful annual general meeting, where some irate investors called for the heads of the board. The telecommunications equipment manufacturer defended itself on the handling of the recent profits warning, as well as its decision to go into the telecoms market when it did. Also attracting attention was the annual meeting of BT, which rose 21/4 to 479p. Its statement touched on operating performance and attempts to cut debt, but analysts said there were no great surprises. ARM Holdings, the micro-chip designer, was down 1/4 at 210lp, despite downbeat news from Intel in the US. Goldman Sachs reiterated its market outperformer rating on the stock. Logica fell 15 to 615p. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded the IT services company from add to a buy with a price target of 800p. FKI, the engineering group, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 250, sliding 55 to 192p, after it said that half-year operating profit would be 15 per cent lower than last year. Boots rose 8 to 638p after the health and beauty retailer gave further details of its planned collaboration with J. Sainsbury. Sainsbury closed up 1l at 431p. Mining companies were hit by the weakness in the price of palladium and platinum. Anglo American lost 55 at 975p, the second biggest blue-chip faller. Rio Tinto was also lower, off 26 at GBP12.25 and BHP Billiton shed 7 at 345p."

Oil and gas stocks weighed heavily on the FTSE 100 throughout the day as the news of a jump in US fuel stocks shaved more than 46 cents off the brent crude prices bringing them down to a three-month low of $24.43 a barrel. Shell dropped 3.9 per cent, BP Amoco slid 3.4 per cent while BG Group shed 4.6 per cent. The UK mining sector also took a tumble on the back of weak platinum and diamond prices as well as an earnings warning from Canada's Alcan. Anglo American was off 5.3 per cent, Rio Tinto lost 2.1 per cent while BHP Billiton fell 2 per cent. More of the same was in store for technology stocks which took a beating following the release of a poor outlook for Intel. The US chip maker beat second-quarter earnings forecasts, but its outlook for the second half of the year suggested that visibility remains low. Apple, the US PC maker, was also cautious on the recovery outlook in its second-quarter earnings report, while ASM Lythography, the Dutch chip equipment maker, warned that it sees no recovery in the sector until the second half of 2002. The news sent Dimension Data down 4.7 per cent, Invensys 2.6 per cent lower and Logica 2.4 per cent weaker. But Colt Telecom bounced 5.4 per cent after falling back sharply on Tuesday amid concerns about future funding. It was a similar story for Energis, which surged 7.1 per cent after sliding more than 10 per cent on Tuesday. But Telewest Communications suffered a 13.5 per cent fall amid growing concerns about cable operator's levels of debt. But Boots, the retail pharmacist, was up 1.3 per cent after announcing that it would sell its health and beauty products in J.Sainsbury's stores. Sainsbury shares were up 0.4 per cent."

Mr MacDonald is one of five fashion and beauty gurus on a panel of experts who will help the chain keep up with the latest trends. He will also be involved in staff training. Boots hopes the new chain will help it grab GBP300m ($441.3m) annual sales from the GBP2.9bn a year market for premium beauty products. The group is investing GBP14m in a pilot programme with eight stores. The first opens in London's Covent Garden on Monday. ""We think Pure Beauty can increase the size of this market by 5 per cent, and take 5 per cent from rivals like department stores,"" said Simon Potts, who is heading the Pure Beauty project. The remaining seven stores should be open before Christmas. If the trial is successful, Boots thinks it could open a total of 65 stores without cannibalising any sales in its core chain. Mr Potts said the stores would be situated away from main Boots branches as the group had chosen areas favoured by niche fashion chains such as Karen Millen, Kookai and Jigsaw. Pure Beauty will stock a wide range of upmarket products - including Origins, Bobby Brown and Clinique, and discoveries such as Amanda Lacey and Ren. The chain will be the first venture by Boots in the beauty market which does not carry the parent company brand name. The name will only appear on some of the group's own-label brands and will be used in in-store video marketing. Mr Potts said market research had shown that Boots customers more readily associated the brand with convenience shopping for practical items. While the group already sold premium beauty products it had decided it could sell more in a chain that was unbranded. The sales staff will get bonuses based on customer satisfaction with the whole store rather than straight sales commission. ""One of the biggest factors limiting growth in this market is the type of women who have often worked behind beauty counters,"" he said. ""Many people are scared of them."""

They were reacting to news that Boots' GBP2.3bn pension scheme had sold all its shares and put its money into AAA rated, long dated bonds. The retailer said it did this partly to eliminate the risk that it would have to make additional payments into its pension scheme when it was underfunded because of falling stock markets. Actuaries said other schemes might also sell shares to buy bonds - some had already been raising their bond holdings - and this would create demand for fixed income securities. ""Companies will try to capitalise on the demand for highly rated corporate bonds,"" said Philip Skottowe at Higham Nobbs, the actuarial firm. He said Tesco, the retailer, had recently issued a bond likely to appeal to pension funds seeking to match their assets with liabilities. Boots added that it sold its equities partly because of a forthcoming accounting standard, FRS 17, which will require companies to reflect their pension fund surpluses or deficits on their balance sheets. That could make companies' good trading results look bad, if weak markets left the fund in deficit. Finance directors with share options have an incentive to make trading results look as good as possible, Mr Skottowe said. Companies were telling pension funds they could not make up all deficits, he said. ""The boards are saying to pension funds: you don't have a blank cheque."" Boots and its pension fund trustees have agreed to keep company payments into the scheme at GBP50m per year for the next three years - down from GBP55m in the year to the end of March. A further benefit of the switch to bonds would be lower investment and dealing charges, Boots said. They would fall to about GBP250,000 per year from GBP10m. The retailer could not say whether the likely lower returns from bonds would oblige it to pay extra money into the pension fund to meet pension promises. It expected to clarify the answer at its interim results on November 8. Boots' decision follows concern that falling stock markets will leave pension funds underfunded and oblige many companies to pay extra money into them. The National Association of Pension Funds said this year that some promises were in danger of becoming ""increasingly unaffordable"". Many companies have limited their pension liability by opening money purchase schemes."
"Factiva-20230329-1434.rtf","Document ftcom00020010715dx61006r3","1 June 2001","Something to smile about.","768 words","Anybody can have a perfect Hollywood smile, according to Malcolm Hughes, chief executive of Oasis Healthcare, the Aim-quoted dentistry group. Hughes claims that British dentists have been too coy about selling themselves. But he adds that, with better branding and marketing, people will learn to love their dentist and many will opt for a sparkling set of teeth. Hughes says: ""In the US, per capita spending on dental care is five to six times higher than in the UK. The key difference is that, in the US, half of all dental treatment is elective - people ask for it. Here 90 per cent of treatment is prescriptive, or what the dentist says needs to be done. There is no aesthetic involved."" That is changing, he says. People are becoming more sensitive about the way they look and are willing to spend more of their disposable income on health and cosmetic products. Hughes says the dental healthcare market is growing at a rate of 14-16 per cent a year. The increasing shift among dentists away from National Health Service work towards more lucrative work in the private sector is also driving growth and profitability. Oasis floated on Ofex in May 1997 with four dental practices. It got off to a difficult start and almost ran out of cash. But it won new backing from several entrepreneurs, and raised GBP1m in an Ofex placing in 1998. Oasis moved on to the Aim market in July last year, raising GBP5.3m with backing from venture capitalists including Jupiter, Singer &Friedlander and Capital for Companies. It raised GBP5.3m with the float and raised a further GBP1.3m in a placing in February. The company has acquired about 24 dental practices since flotation, trebling group turnover to about GBP16m this year. It has 38 practices representing 160 surgeries. The target is to acquire and develop 100 practices by 2003. It still has GBP1m in cash and access to a GBP7.5m loan facility with Bank of Scotland. Each newly acquired practice is rebranded under the Oasis name. About GBP1m has been spent in the past year modernising, expanding and refitting surgeries with equipment. Refurbished practices are replacing what Hughes describes as often shabby premises with unattractive reception areas after under-investment in the public sector. The target is for a practice to be producing 15 per cent operating margins within three years. Dentists are won over partly because their NHS incomes have been under pressure - dentists in the private sector typically earn twice that of NHS practitioners. The old model of conventional dental practices is collapsing, says Hughes, who joined Oasis in 1999 after 25 years in the corporate sector. ""The older partner about to retire will offer a young dentist the practice. The bank lends the money and you find that you are highly geared and only in your 20s. Why gear up so young? Running a practice is a lot of grief,"" he says. ""And people are more fussy. They don't want to go into a surgery where the wallpaper is peeling and there is a five-year-old copy of the Daily Telegraph in the waiting room."" Hughes says the market is highly fragmented, providing scope for consolidation. There is only a handful of similar operators, led by Integrated Dental Holdings. Boots has led the way on the high street, with its walk-in dental services, but Hughes says this is a plus. ""When a company like Boots comes in spending millions to develop a brand, we benefit. They have said they want to have 50 centres on the high street. That is one tenth of 1 per cent of the market."" Oasis is forecast to reduce its losses to about GBP200,000 to the end of March this year from GBP200,000 last year, before moving into profit of around GBP800,000 next year. Sales last year were GBP3m. Philip Blackburn, of Laing Buisson, the healthcare analysts, says competition may come from other retail chains threatening to enter the sector. He adds that the market's prospects may be hampered by the tradition of free dental care in the UK. ""There is a psychological barrier to spending on dental care even though we were told en masse 10 years ago we would have to pay,"" Blackburn says. ""But nearly 40 per cent of dental care is now private and the sector is growing. The venture capitalists are investing in the industry, so the returns must be high enough to satisfy them."""
"Factiva-20230329-1434.rtf","Document ftcom00020010715dx61006nk","1 June 2001","A deal that sends a message to the world.","1,064 words","Just when you thought conglomerates had gone safely out of fashion, they are making waves again - this time not in the grimy old world of industry but in the fast-moving media business. Once, advertising was a straightforward affair. A company with a product to sell would pay an advertising agency to make a commercial and a media buying agency would negotiate with media owners for the space and air time to carry the resulting campaign. But consolidation in the media industry is altering the relationship between clients, their agencies and the media owners, driving negotiations into the hands of global holding companies that wrap up millions of dollars' worth of advertising over a period of years in a single deal. Yesterday the biggest deal yet of this type was announced. Procter &Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser - and in many ways a holding company in its own right - said it had signed an ""unprecedented"" cross-platform marketing agreement with Viacom, the world's second largest media conglomerate. The agreement means that instead of negotiating to buy air time with each of Viacom's individual media interests, P&G has bought a year's worth of air time across a spread of 12 Viacom television properties: the CBS television network, MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite, CMT, BET, UPN, TV Land, Paramount Television, King World and Comedy Central. The parties declined to put a figure on the deal but industry sources estimate it incorporates about $300m worth of air time in the first year. If it works out, it will be extended indefinitely - and possibly across other platforms in the Viacom empire, which includes outdoor advertising and internet ventures. The deal echoes changes that have been going on in the advertising industry, where global advertising agency holding companies such as WPP, Omnicom and Interpublic have started to pitch for big corporations' entire advertising and marketing business instead of leaving it to their constituent agencies. Recent examples include Coca-Cola's decision to make Interpublic its ""brand steward"", DaimlerChrysler's decision to give all its advertising to Omnicom and a decision by Boots, the UK retailing group, to award all its advertising and marketing work to WPP. Superficially, the trend seems to be highly advantageous to Viacom, WPP and other conglomerates in the media and advertising business. The old argument is that global clients want global solutions, so the bigger a media conglomerate can grow, the more likely it will win the biggest customers' business. Yet there is a strong suspicion among some media analysts that the trend is driven by nothing more revolutionary than price. Big global clients such as P&G have the muscle to negotiate the lowest rates and the big advertising and media conglomerates may be willing to accept lower prices in return for higher volume. ""Whatever it is that P&G is buying, and whatever it is that Viacom is selling, P&G could have bought on its own anyway. It's not as if they needed permission to buy this stuff,"" says Alan Gottesman, who follows the advertising industry as managing director of West End Communications/Consulting in New York. The parties to the P&G/ Viacom deal insist price is not the deciding factor. ""It's not just an oversized media deal. There are a lot of components that really require much more of a partnership, rather than just 'you sit on one side of the table and I sit on the other and we hammer each other over price',"" says Donna Salvatore, chief executive officer of MediaVest USA, P&G's buying agency. For example, Ms Salvatore says, P&G is the biggest supplier of client-produced television programming in the US, already supplying Viacom's television properties with two soap operas, made-for-television films and other shows. These could be cross-marketed across all Viacom's properties, much in the manner of CBS's recently broadcast Survivor television show. Viacom and P&G yesterday cited industry estimates suggesting that cross-platform agreements could represent up to 40 per cent of all media arrangements in coming years. Indeed, P&G's ""unprecedented"" deal with Viacom is unprecedented only in size. AOL Time Warner, the biggest US media conglomerate, is also making great claims about its ability to cross-promote on the internet, cable television and in magazines. Since AOL and Time Warner completed their merger in January, the company has announced a number of advertising packages sold to companies such as Cisco, Continental Airlines and Swatch. As part of the Continental deal, the airline agreed to devote some of its promotional budget to AOL's nascent mobile communicator programme - which means advertising on wireless phones in addition to more traditional media. AOL formed an executive committee called the Advertising Council, which brings together the marketing chiefs of all the different divisions. The group says it is able to assemble big multi-channel packages for marketers, eliminating tedious parts of the process. Still, some industry figures harbour deep suspicions about the one-stop shopping idea. Unless it comes at such a low price that it simply cannot be resisted, they argue, clients are usually better off shopping around for the best service they can get from wherever it is available rather than being locked into a single conglomerate's offerings. ""We have always done cross-platform work. We call it media planning. The notion that you have to buy it all from one place is kind of silly, in my view,"" says the head of one media buying agency. Mr Gottesman says one reason why deals such as these could be slow to take off is that they are extremely complex to implement and ""pitifully few"" senior executives within advertising and media conglomerates have the skills to do so. He says it will be interesting to see in two years whether the P&G/ Viacom deal has worked. In the meantime, he says, ""there is an old adage in negotiations. When the other guy says it's not about the money, you know it's about the money."" Additional reporting by Christopher Grimes."

The company will initially open eight ""Pure Beauty"" stores, the first in London's Covent Garden in September. But it sees room for a total of 65 stores in large urban centres stocking high end cosmetics, fragrances, skin and hair care products, vitamins and beauty accessories. Boots hopes its new retail concept will increase its share of the GBP3bn ($4.3bn) cosmetics market by 5 per cent. The announcement came as the company reported a rise in pre-tax profit before exceptionals to GBP581.1m from GBP570.8m in the year ended March 31, in line with expectations of GBP550m-GBP590m. After exceptionals, the pre-tax line dropped to GBP492.2m on turnover almost flat at GBP5.22bn compared with GBP5.19bn previously. In the past, Boots has been criticised by analysts for adding costs into the exceptionals line that some believed were simply part of doing business. Last November, the group announced a GBP100m cost-cutting drive which is due to be completed by next March. Boots will eliminate more than 1,000 jobs, mainly from the chemists chain, and focus the business on health and beauty. Sales at the core Boots The Chemist chain rose 0.3 per cent but fell 0.2 per cent on a like-for-like basis as the group continued its managed exit from non-core leisure ranges including CDs, cookware and home brewing kits. As the sales mix changed, however, overall gross margins strengthened by 0.5 per cent. Steve Russell, chief executive, said he was confident the health and beauty sales would move ahead and margin improvement would continue. ""We are confident of the outcome for the year and expect that the pattern of profit improvement will favour the second half,"" he said."" Boots warned earlier this month that the abolition of price fixing on over-the-counter drugs would reduce profits by about GBP15m-GBP20m per year over the next 18 months to two years. Boots Healthcare International, the subsidiary that makes OTC treatments including Nurofen and Strepsils, turned in a strong performance last year. Lifted by the Clearasil acquisition, sales rose 13 per cent to GBP362m. The picture was less rosy at Halfords, the car and bike accessory chain, which saw operating profit fall 18.1 per cent to GBP37m. The international retail division, which is focused in south east Asia, also had a poor year, with operating losses widening to GBP43.9m from GBP33.1m. Rowan Morgan, analyst at Teather &Greenwood, was impressed by the full-year figures and said he believes that Boots' shares, last down 9p at 5713/4p, are good value. ""These results should provide some consolation to the market,"" he said. ""Not only are they in line but there are no nasty surprises and some of the rumour going around the market will be dispelled."" Earnings per share were 37.9p against 45p. The final dividend of 18.5p makes a yearly total of 26.3p, an increase of 4.4 per cent."

That was Yves Saint Laurent, in a Proustian mood, recalling one of his vintage Moroccan moments. This recollection is particularly poignant as his quotation comes from 1984, those crazy, far-from-lazy days of power-dressing and shoulder pads, when North Africa's heyday as the playground of plutocratic potheads seemed much more distant than it does now. Once again, fashion is having a Moroccan moment, with, of course, Tom Ford, in his Yves Saint Laurent incarnation, telling us what to wear for it. The caftan is king again, and, from the excitement that has greeted Ford's interpretation, one would think he had invented something entirely new rather than having reinvented a garment that's been kicking around parts of Russia, the Ottoman Empire and some regions of Africa for a few centuries. Mind you, trichologically challenged Ford wields so much commercial clout these days that if his next collection featured black bin liners, shops would stock it, magazines would be more than happy to advertise it and, most probably, not a few of us would buy it. As ever, Ford is quick to identify trends. Carrying fringed shoulder bags, trailing belts that dangle around the hips, and slipping into moccasin boots, this summer, it's Hideous Kinky here we come. Ford is adept at reinterpreting past classics, and stopping short of pastiche; his caftans in an array of leopard prints are this season's in thing. But if we are talking 21st century hippie chicks, give me a girl in a Roberto Cavalli caftan any day. Cavalli was there the first time round, helping shape the sensibilities of the generation. But what are either of these designers, and plenty more, doing - bringing back a garment as notoriously difficult to wear with anything approaching chic and elan as the caftan? The genius of Saint Laurent was that his designs, including the caftan, reflected, even prompted, cultural shifts in fashion, and they made money. As a boy, he grew up in colonial Oran, Algeria, and, while it was possible to take the young designer out of the colonies, it proved far more difficult to extract the colonies from the designer. In 1967, a decade after he was named as the successor to Dior, Saint Laurent discovered Marrakech. With Pierre Berge he bought a villa in the Medina called the Snake House, followed in later years by the purchase of the House of Serene Happiness in 1974, and then, in 1980, the Villa Oasis and the Majorelle Gardens. He forged his friendship with those billionaire gypsies, the Gettys, in 1967. And it is from this era that the iconic image of Talitha Getty crouching on a crenellated Moroccan rooftop dates. The polychromatic coat she wears recalls the ceremonial caftans worn by the sultans of the Ottoman Empire, the cowled male figure in the background adds to the drama, while her eyes, looking into some ill-defined point in the future, have a dreamy mystic vacancy about them. It was endemic, given the place and the time. As John Hopkins recalls in his book, The Tangier Diaries: 1962-79, almost anyone who was anyone was wasted most of the time, especially if they hung around the Gettys. ""Last night Paul and Talitha Getty threw a New Year's eve party at their palace in the Medina,"" recalls Hopkins. ""John Lennon and Paul McCartney were there, flat on their backs. They couldn't get off the floor, let alone talk. I've never seen so many people out of control."" Although it seems laughable now, people really did seem to think that if they smoked enough pot, dropped enough acid and imbibed enough eastern philosophy, they could synthesise a new Utopia based upon communal principles. Slip into your caftan, torch up a reefer, crash out on a bean bag and just wait for the doors of perception to open, man. In this unisex, countercultural world, the caftan (with the option of a string of beads) was a de facto uniform. Of course, it wore better in Tangiers than it ever would at soggy northern European pop festivals on the Duke of Bedford's estate. Now, more than 30 years later, Talitha Getty, the hostess with the overpowering hospitality, is this season's fashion icon. Like Jane Birkin, a runner-up in the race for role model of summer 2002, she outraged society, or at least that portion of it that was not so stoned as to be capable of outrage, and dazzled it with her haunting beauty. Her status as the original haute boheme was confirmed in that most tragic of ways: she died, barely in her 30s, of an overdose of heroin. The caftan proved more resilient, clinging on until well into the 1970s. It was just that the people who wore it had changed. Once the chosen garb of the heroin-thin, high (as a kite) Bohemia of Marrakech, it became the choice of the fuller-figured icon: Elizabeth Taylor and roly-poly Mediterranean lover-boy par excellence Demis Roussos, who brought the sound of moussaka, retsina and kebabs into a generation of suburban drawing rooms, including, of course, the one in Abigail's Party. At least then the caftan spoke of a certain kind of freedom, the abandon of North Africa or the eastern Mediterranean. Now, however, its message is diluted.

Manassis quit ahead of Wednesday's extraordinary meeting of OTE shareholders to elect a new board of directors. However, as the Greek state is still the biggest shareholder with a 42 per cent stake, the government was expected to nominate the new chairman and chief executive and retain control of the board. People close to the company said Lefteris Antonacopoulos, head of the Greek Federation of Industry, would take over. His appointment would signal a loosening of political control over OTE as it prepares to face increased competition following full deregulation of Greek telecoms last year. A former senior executive with Royal Dutch/Shell, Antonacopoulos would be the first manager from the private sector to run OTE. Kerin Hope Business Post to hire former Post Office CEO Business Post is hiring Bill Cockburn, a former chief executive of the Post Office, as non-executive deputy chairman. Cockburn, 59, was chief executive of the Post Office from 1992 to 1995 and stood down last year as BT's group managing director after overseeing the restructuring of its UK operations. Paul Carvell, Business Post's chief executive, said: ""Bill ran Royal Mail when it was a highly successful, profitable organisation. He knows how Royal Mail and Consignia work. He brings added fire power to the board and has knowledge and experience of international post offices."" He will take up his job at at the start of April. Business Post, based in Birmingham, is one of the country's largest express parcel delivery companies and a rival to Consignia. It is keen for UK Mail, its subsidiary, to win a permanent licence to operate in the lucrative bulk business mail market, following the postal regulator's recommendation in January to remove Consignia's monopoly on the market. The regulator is set in the next few weeks to finalise its proposals for granting permanent licences to private sector companies. Business Post is one of two private sector companies to be awarded an interim licence to operate mail services for business customers. The licence begins in the late spring or early summer, and the group is seeking a 2 to 3 per cent share of the letter delivery market within three or four years. Cockburn, also a former chief executive of WH Smith, will concentrate on the development of UK Mail. Cockburn was a Post Office employee from the age of 18. Sarah Laitner GW Pharmaceuticals names director Roger Pertwee, professor of neuropharmacology at the University of Aberdeen, has joined GW Pharmaceuticals as director of pharmacology. Pertwee has been a frequent consultant to the government on the therapeutic potential of cannabis. His appointment is the first step in the creation of a cannabinoid research institute. Dr Geoffrey Guy, executive chairman of GW, said the institute would act as a bridge between commercial enterprise and academia. GW, the only company in the world to develop regulated medicines from cannabis plants, has developed a therapeutic cannabis extract spray. Prof Pertwee will focus on pharmacology in support of clinical trial programmes and research. More Movers Charles Ralph has been appointed group finance director of Hamptons International.

The health and beauty retailer admitted there had been ""some contradictory indications"" on the effects of botulin toxin type A, injected into the face to smooth wrinkles. But the group's directors said they would recommend the treatment to members of their own families. The treatment is part of a variety of services, including dentistry and chiropody, that are on trial at Boots in order to help breathe fresh life into its stagnant sales performance. Sales in the year to March 31 were just 2 per cent ahead at GBP5.33bn (GBP5.23bn). Pre-tax profits were GBP596m (GBP492m), but before exceptionals were up by just under 10 per cent at GBP639m. Boots Retail, which accounts for 80 per cent of sales, increased profits by 1 per cent to GBP572m, while international operations incurred losses of GBP24m. Within the retail arm Boots the Chemist grew sales 2 per cent, with a weak performance from healthcare and beauty. Steve Russell, chief executive admitted that the group ""must drive health and beauty sales much harder"" in an increasingly competitive environment. Boots Healthcare International profits rose 13 per cent to GBP67m. Halfords, the car parts and bicycle chain operation which is being demerged or sold, was the strongest performer with sales up 30 per cent to GBP54m. The group is on track to lose Halfords from its portfolio ""roughly"" in the third quarter. The trial of Boots within Sainsburys is being expanded from six to nine outlets. A final dividend of 19.3p, makes a total of 27.4p (26.3p), payable from earnings per share of 45.9p (36.7p). The shares fell 16p to 676p. Comment Driving top line growth was mentioned no fewer than 25 times in the results presentation. Years of under-investment has contributed to poor product availability, which is showing up in the underlying trading performance. Market share in key parts of its business, including healthcare and beauty, has been lost as food retailers encroach. Its foray into value-added products and services, such as Pure Beauty cosmetics and dentistry, is losing money, and it remains unclear whether satisfactory returns are achievable. It is spending GBP170m on refurbishing 300 stores over four years, with particular emphasis on the London area. On SG Securities' pre-exceptional profits forecast of GBP672m for the current year, the forward p/e ratio is just above 12. The discount to the sector looks fair given the uphill task faced by management."

Talking up the retailer's prospects for Christmas, Steve Russell, chief executive, suddenly let slip the fact that the group was again stocking up on toys and CDs. It is two and a half years since Boots started a long and painful withdrawal from this market as it sought to turn itself into a pure health and beauty retailer. And it has been complaining about the drag on its figures from the exit ever since. What on earth is it doing going back into it? According to Mr Russell, Boots customers expect to buy gifts there at Christmas - so back comes the previously discredited merchandise, just for one quarter a year. It is hardly a consistent approach to retailing. With analysts calculating that inventories have increased by GBP100m, the spectre of a nasty post-Christmas stock overhang of tat raises its ugly head. There was not much else to cheer on Thursday. Falling profits, rising costs, sinking margins, lost market share. No news on big roll-outs in the Well Being areas that Mr Russell has identified as key to the future. He insists that the core pharmacy business is doing fine, but even here there are clouds on the horizon. The Office of Fair Trading is about to pronounce on possible deregulation of pharmacy licences. Any moves in this direction would leave Boots even more vulnerable to the onward march of the voracious supermarket groups. There was a little good news. Howard Dodd, the new finance director, has acted with speed to bring some much needed reform to the group's financial reporting policies. The old regime was widely regarded as unnecessarily aggressive in flaunting its financial acumen. No investors bought Boots for accountancy smoke and mirror tricks. However, all the financial tidying in the world cannot disguise the fact that what is on offer from Boots - yet again - is jam tomorrow. The gossipy world of retailing thinks Stuart Rose is after Mr Russell's job as he searches for a post-Arcadia bolt-hole. The performance on Thursday will not have deterred him. Man alive A hedge fund manager recently came up to Stanley Fink, chief executive of Man, the largest listed hedge fund group, and apologised for shorting the company's shares. The move, the manager explained, was designed to hedge the risk of his own business underperforming. The manager does not seem to be alone: anecdotal reports from analysts suggest quite a number of hedge funds have an appetite for shorting Man's stock, either for hedging reasons or on investment grounds. However, the interim figures probably gave rather more ammunition to bulls who are long of the stock, with group sales strong, performance fees up 7 per cent, and earnings per share up 36 per cent, all broadly in line with market expectations. The bull case for Man is that it occupies a prime position in a sector of the fund management industry that has been growing strongly until recently and the company has managed to buck the current shake-out, picking up market share from weaker rivals. If it maintains its performance record it should see strong long-term growth if, as Mr Fink expects, alternative investment grows from 2 per cent of global assets under management to 5-10 per cent over the next decade. Man not only has a good record in fund performance through AHL, a prime driver of its profitability, but also an ability to package products to customers' needs that is unusual among hedge funds. On top of all this, RFM, the Switzerland-based manager it acquired earlier this year, has extended the group's range in the continental institutional market and on Thursday produced encouraging sales figures, despite fears to the contrary. The bears, however, could point to weakness in the performance of Glenwood, its US fund of funds, because of the collapse of a fund within the portfolio, at a time when the group needs to expand its presence in the key US market, accounting for about 50 per cent of hedge fund investment. Some analysts also question the value created by the recent bolt-on acquisition of the GNI brokerage, though this is expected to be earnings enhancing in its first full financial year. And despite the recent diversification, the share price will continue to be strongly influenced - for better or worse - by the performance of AHL, which had a strong first half. The shares dropped sharply on Thursday in a technical reaction to the company's convertible bond issue. They could claw some of that back but it is hard to see them moving near term out of their trading range. Aim A little noted aspect of the EU's botched prospectus directive is that it could pose a fresh threat to Aim, London's lightly-regulated market for smaller companies. As advisers Grant Thornton pointed out on Thursday, the directive makes some vague references to less onerous regulation of smaller companies, but it will be up to the Financial Services Authority to ensure the market is ring-fenced.

"Factiva-20230329-1436 (1).rtf","Document ftcom00020021108dyb700014","7 November 2002","Strange meeting.","1,186 words","As Remembrance Day approaches, Max Egremont visits an impressive exhibition of 12 soldier-poets that reveals how they were victims of the first world war in their work as well as in their lives. The first world war inspired poetry before the digging of the first trench. A war poem - Henry Newbolt's ""The Vigil"" - appeared in the Times on August 5 1914 (the British ultimatum to Germany had expired the previous evening), and several hundred were submitted each day that month. Some of the poems were by established writers such as Hardy, Newbolt, Bridges and Kipling, others by unknown poets, many of them soldiers at the front; by August 1915 several thousand poems had been sent. The front-line poets were almost all volunteers, filled with the lyrical idealism felt generally at that time. Even older writers such as Edmund Gosse looked on the war as an opportunity for cleansing, for re-asserting wholesome values in a politically turbulent, even decadent, peace-time Britain. How different it all seems now, as can be seen by the moving exhibition on 12 first war soldier poets, ""Anthem for Doomed Youth"" (the title is taken from a poem by Wilfred Owen) at the Imperial War Museum in London. The poets are the familiar ones - Sassoon, Owen, Blunden, Edward Thomas, Brooke, Julian Grenfell, Graves, Rosenberg, the composer Ivor Gurney: two perhaps not so familiar (Charles Sorley and David Jones), and one probably not known to many (and an excellent choice): the Irishman Francis Ledwidge. This exhibition is clear, not cluttered, although there is a lot of material. Each poet has his section, starting with the enthusiasm of 1914, and the deaths the next year of Brooke and Grenfell, and passing through the astonishing maturity of Sorley (killed in 1915 aged 20) to the war weariness of Sassoon and Owen and Graves. It shows the affronted pastoralism of Thomas, Blunden and Gurney, David Jones's transformation of the war into Celtic myth and Isaac Rosenberg's stark, unsentimental poems. In addition to manuscripts and letters and photographs (often compelling), there are Sassoon's boots and pistol, Edward Thomas's watch that was stopped by the shell that killed him, Owen's Military Cross, a lock of Rupert Brooke's hair. Specially chilling is Grenfell's 1914 game book that, after lists of slaughtered stags and rabbits, suddenly reads ""November 16: 1 Pomeranian. November 17: 2 Pomeranians."" Between and above the show cases hang paintings of the poets and the war: works by Nevinson, Clausen, Rosenberg's self-portraits, the western front landscapes by Paul Nash, one a scene of devastation called ""We are Making a New World"". The poems, and the pictures, show irony as a protective weapon. And many of the photographs have a terrible irony of their own, such as those of the romantic narcissistic Rupert Brooke (the ultimate example of the writer as a pin-up) or a watchful Sorley with his thin adolescent moustache. Julian Grenfell, eldest son of Lord Desborough, shows aristocratic disdain, and the cool defiant look of Francis Ledwidge, an Irish nationalist, perhaps reflects the fact that he volunteered (and was killed) for the less bad of his two enemies: the British Empire as against the Kaiser's Germany. Ledwidge spanned both sides of the Ireland of his time: the unionist and the nationalist. Shocked by the executions that followed the Easter Rising of 1916, he was saved by death from having to jettison one for the other. Most of the poets became officers, and many had been to public schools - although not Gurney, Jones, Ledwidge, Rosenberg or Owen - where a classical education had preached chivalry, sacrifice and duty. The exhibition displays Brooke's schoolboy cricket cap, Sorley in the rugby team at Marlborough, Graves's boxing cup won at Charterhouse and the gown Blunden might have worn at Christ's Hospital, while John Hassall's mawkish picture of St George in armour watching over the western front sums up the sentimentality. There was something dehumanising in all this. To Grenfell, for instance, individuals or other lives did not seem to have mattered much against the idea of himself as a solitary hunter-warrior at one with the earth and his quarry and death. He admitted fear after being under fire for the first time, writing to his mother, ""I longed to be able to say I liked it"", but went on to win several medals for bravery. Disillusionment came when the slaughter started. Even Brooke, who saw little fighting, wrote his last poem in a mood of foreboding as his troopship steamed towards Gallipoli. Several poets, as Jon Stallworthy's fine accompanying book makes clear, welcomed the war. Grenfell, impatient with the affectation and conventionality of a still powerful upper class, had escaped into the army but found peace-time soldiering dull, Edward Thomas hated his literary hack work and the homosexual Sassoon was uncertain of his future and talent before 1914. A few, however, were clearly about to break out - Sorley through a discovery of independence made (paradoxically) when studying in Germany, Owen while working as a teacher in Bordeaux: for them, if not for poetry, 1914 was a tragedy. The war haunted the survivors. Graves had nightmares about the trenches in his 80s, Gurney ended up in an asylum, Sassoon, Blunden and Jones kept returning to it in their writing. Now their work seems inextricably tied up with it (some, like Blunden, went on writing war poems after 1918), with the mud, the blundering generals, exploding shells and winging shrapnel, the rifle's crack, the dawn whistle telling the troops to go over the top. The images of the war itself are so sharp (and important) in British national consciousness that the history books cannot convey them, so the poets have taken over. How plodding and forgettable the researches and statistics and claims of historians (who were not there) seem to our facile minds beside Owen's vision of hell or Sassoon's satire and anger. Much in this exhibition brings back the power of these images, and myths, blurring the poems themselves. The shyly smiling David Jones, boyishly out of place in a military overcoat, now seems inseparable from In Parenthesis and far easier to comprehend, and the image of the telegram announcing Wilfred Owen's death arriving as the church bells celebrated the armistice is better-known than most of Owen's poetry. The best poems, such as Owen's ""Strange Meeting"", Rosenberg's ""Dead Men's Dump"", Thomas's ""As the Team's Head-Brass"" or Blunden's ""Report on Experience"", both transcend and define their circumstances. But after seeing the haunting reminders of what they went through, one feels these 12 soldier poets were victims of the first world war in their work as well as in their lives. Perhaps this combination of personal and poetic drama is the reason they still seem so impressive. 'Anthem for Doomed Youth' is at the Imperial War Museum, London SE1 until April 27. Jon Stallworthy's accompanying book is published by Constable &Robinson at GBP14.99."

As the European Union strives to meet its ambitious goal of a single market in financial services by 2005, the process for turning proposals into law is concentrating power in a little-known body: the EU's Committee of European Securities Regulators. CESR, pronounced ""Caesar"", has been accused of developing imperial ambitions. Its public profile, however, is remarkably low key. It is to be found in neither the concrete jungle of the EU quarter of Brussels nor a tower block in Frankfurt. Its small secretariat occupies an anonymous office block near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. But this network of national securities regulators has emerged as the crucial drafter of standards in the complex committee structure adopted this year to speed the introduction of EU securities market legislation. ""Knowledge is power,"" says Christopher Huhne, a European member of parliament closely involved with financial legislation. ""The regulators are key in the whole process because they are thought to be the only ones who understand the markets."" The new method of legislating, devised by a group of ""wise men"" headed by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, a former Belgian central banker, drastically pruned debate on financial legislation in the European parliament and the EU Council of Ministers so that all 42 measures of the EU's financial services action plan could be implemented on schedule. Mr Lamfalussy specified that normal EU legislative procedures, based on proposals from the Commission with approval from the parliament and EU member states, should apply only to broad framework legislation in financial services. His process delegated detailed legislation to two new committees. Pride of place went to a new EU securities committee of senior treasury officials, which would approve new laws. CESR was cast in a supporting role to advise the Commission in framing detailed legislation and to ensure consistency throughout the EU. But, so far, CESR has emerged as the more important operator. In theory, its main role should be to draft complex technical texts following mandates from the Commission. But in practice its members advise the Commission and national governments on how to frame the new laws. CESR then sets the tone for the eventual implementation of the new regulations in its detailed drafting. It is a diligent body. Its consultative documents on how to implement EU-wide financial legislation thud regularly into the government relations offices of financial services companies and trade associations. Its proposals for introducing harmonised prospectuses throughout the EU run to more than 400 pages. But not everybody is happy with its efforts. CESR fell foul of financial journalists because it initially failed to consult on its detailed proposals for ""market abuse"" legislation to crack down on insider trading and illicit market manipulation. Journalists also objected to the idea of being subject to financial market regulators but failed to persuade the Commission and the European parliament to back their position. The market abuse directive was the first legislation in which CESR was involved. Theresa Villiers, a British MEP who monitors CESR's activities in the European parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee, found its approach was ""too much, too detailed, overly intrusive and overly bureaucratic"". Angela Knight, chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims), a London trade body, says CESR has improved its consultation with market practitioners but is producing rules that are far more detailed than expected. ""So what the right hand is doing better, the left hand is doing worse."" Arthur Docters van Leeuwen, CESR's chairman, thinks the criticism of his organisation has been largely mis-directed. The demand for detail comes from the market participants, not the regulators, he says. ""In the end, probably only about 10 per cent of the detail in consultative documents finds its way into being rules."" CESR's working parties ""don't sit round a table saying 'What are we going to implement?' There's always pressure from outside."" He also rejects suggestions that CESR has become too big for its boots. ""We are accountable to the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European securities committee and the parliament. And we are accountable to the public: every paper that we do is on our website; every document that we issue undergoes a quite rigorous process of consultation."" Perhaps predictably, Mr Van Leeuwen also plays down the idea that CESR is too powerful. ""I don't see us as so very powerful. What is power?"" he asks. ""But I'm not saying that we have no influence. If you put 17 and, after enlargement, 27 regulators around the table and they agree on something, that's influence. But as long as this influence is under good governance, I don't see why it should be bad. ""It is only bad if you don't want to have a single financial market. But when you say, as Lamfalussy did about the securities market, that we have a labyrinth of Kafkaesque dimensions in Europe, you have to do something to straighten this labyrinth out."""

""Knowledge is power,"" says Christopher Huhne, a European member of parliament closely involved with financial legislation. ""The regulators are key in the whole process because they are thought to be the only ones who understand the markets."" The new method of legislating, devised by a group of ""wise men"" headed by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, a former Belgian central banker, drastically pruned debate on financial legislation in the European parliament and the EU Council of Ministers so that all 42 measures of the EU's financial services action plan could be implemented on schedule. Mr Lamfalussy specified that normal EU legislative procedures, based on proposals from the Commission with approval from the parliament and EU member states, should apply only to broad framework legislation in financial services. His process delegated detailed legislation to two new committees. Pride of place went to a new EU securities committee of senior treasury officials, which would approve new laws. CESR was cast in a supporting role to advise the Commission in framing detailed legislation and to ensure consistency throughout the EU. But, so far, CESR has emerged as the more important operator. In theory, its main role should be to draft complex technical texts following mandates from the Commission. But in practice its members advise the Commission and national governments on how to frame the new laws. CESR then sets the tone for the eventual implementation of the new regulations in its detailed drafting. It is a diligent body. Its consultative documents on how to implement EU-wide financial legislation thud regularly into the government relations offices of financial services companies and trade associations. Its proposals for introducing harmonised prospectuses throughout the EU run to more than 400 pages. But not everybody is happy with its efforts. CESR fell foul of financial journalists because it initially failed to consult on its detailed proposals for ""market abuse"" legislation to crack down on insider trading and illicit market manipulation. Journalists also objected to the idea of being subject to financial market regulators but failed to persuade the Commission and the European parliament to back their position. The market abuse directive was the first legislation in which CESR was involved. Theresa Villiers, a British MEP who monitors CESR's activities in the European parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee, found its approach was ""too much, too detailed, overly intrusive and overly bureaucratic"". Angela Knight, chief executive of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims), a London trade body, says CESR has improved its consultation with market practitioners but is producing rules that are far more detailed than expected. ""So what the right hand is doing better, the left hand is doing worse."" Arthur Docters van Leeuwen, CESR's chairman, thinks the criticism of his organisation has been largely mis-directed. The demand for detail comes from the market participants, not the regulators, he says. ""In the end, probably only about 10 per cent of the detail in consultative documents finds its way into being rules."" CESR's working parties ""don't sit round a table saying 'What are we going to implement?' There's always pressure from outside."" He also rejects suggestions that CESR has become too big for its boots. ""We are accountable to the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European securities committee and the parliament. And we are accountable to the public: every paper that we do is on our website; every document that we issue undergoes a quite rigorous process of consultation."" Perhaps predictably, Mr Van Leeuwen also plays down the idea that CESR is too powerful. ""I don't see us as so very powerful. What is power?"" he asks. ""But I'm not saying that we have no influence. If you put 17 and, after enlargement, 27 regulators around the table and they agree on something, that's influence. But as long as this influence is under good governance, I don't see why it should be bad. ""It is only bad if you don't want to have a single financial market. But when you say, as Lamfalussy did about the securities market, that we have a labyrinth of Kafkaesque dimensions in Europe, you have to do something to straighten this labyrinth out."""

Talking up the retailer's prospects for Christmas, Steve Russell, chief executive, suddenly let slip the fact that the group was again stocking up on toys and CDs. It is two and a half years since Boots started a long and painful withdrawal from this market as it sought to turn itself into a pure health and beauty retailer. And it has been complaining about the drag on its figures from the exit ever since. What on earth is it doing going back into it? According to Mr Russell, Boots customers expect to buy gifts there at Christmas - so back comes the previously discredited merchandise, just for one quarter a year. It is hardly a consistent approach to retailing. With analysts calculating that inventories have increased by GBP100m, the spectre of a nasty post-Christmas stock overhang of tat raises its ugly head. There was not much else to cheer on Thursday. Falling profits, rising costs, sinking margins, lost market share. No news on big roll-outs in the Well Being areas that Mr Russell has identified as key to the future. He insists that the core pharmacy business is doing fine, but even here there are clouds on the horizon. The Office of Fair Trading is about to pronounce on possible deregulation of pharmacy licences. Any moves in this direction would leave Boots even more vulnerable to the onward march of the voracious supermarket groups. There was a little good news. Howard Dodd, the new finance director, has acted with speed to bring some much needed reform to the group's financial reporting policies. The old regime was widely regarded as unnecessarily aggressive in flaunting its financial acumen. No investors bought Boots for accountancy smoke and mirror tricks. However, all the financial tidying in the world cannot disguise the fact that what is on offer from Boots - yet again - is jam tomorrow. The gossipy world of retailing thinks Stuart Rose is after Mr Russell's job as he searches for a post-Arcadia bolt-hole. The performance on Thursday will not have deterred him. Man alive A hedge fund manager recently came up to Stanley Fink, chief executive of Man, the largest listed hedge fund group, and apologised for shorting the company's shares. The move, the manager explained, was designed to hedge the risk of his own business underperforming. The manager does not seem to be alone: anecdotal reports from analysts suggest quite a number of hedge funds have an appetite for shorting Man's stock, either for hedging reasons or on investment grounds. However, the interim figures probably gave rather more ammunition to bulls who are long of the stock, with group sales strong, performance fees up 7 per cent, and earnings per share up 36 per cent, all broadly in line with market expectations. The bull case for Man is that it occupies a prime position in a sector of the fund management industry that has been growing strongly until recently and the company has managed to buck the current shake-out, picking up market share from weaker rivals. If it maintains its performance record it should see strong long-term growth if, as Mr Fink expects, alternative investment grows from 2 per cent of global assets under management to 5-10 per cent over the next decade. Man not only has a good record in fund performance through AHL, a prime driver of its profitability, but also an ability to package products to customers' needs that is unusual among hedge funds. On top of all this, RFM, the Switzerland-based manager it acquired earlier this year, has extended the group's range in the continental institutional market and on Thursday produced encouraging sales figures, despite fears to the contrary. The bears, however, could point to weakness in the performance of Glenwood, its US fund of funds, because of the collapse of a fund within the portfolio, at a time when the group needs to expand its presence in the key US market, accounting for about 50 per cent of hedge fund investment. Some analysts also question the value created by the recent bolt-on acquisition of the GNI brokerage, though this is expected to be earnings enhancing in its first full financial year. And despite the recent diversification, the share price will continue to be strongly influenced - for better or worse - by the performance of AHL, which had a strong first half. The shares dropped sharply on Thursday in a technical reaction to the company's convertible bond issue. They could claw some of that back but it is hard to see them moving near term out of their trading range. Aim A little noted aspect of the EU's botched prospectus directive is that it could pose a fresh threat to Aim, London's lightly-regulated market for smaller companies. As advisers Grant Thornton pointed out on Thursday, the directive makes some vague references to less onerous regulation of smaller companies, but it will be up to the Financial Services Authority to ensure the market is ring-fenced.

"Factiva-20230329-1436.rtf","Document ftcom00020020902dy910000d","1 September 2002","Transition trade sees a boost to its profile.","915 words","Transition management may sound as though it is just another piece of business geek-speak dreamed up by management consultants, but it is fast becoming a core part of any thriving investment house. Last year, transition managers - using their skills to buy and sell significant chunks of equities or bonds - handled as much as GBP200bn of pension fund money across Europe. They even hit the headlines: last year, Boots, the UK high street chemists chain, used Legal and General when it switched GBP1.7bn of equities into bonds. The expectation is that transition management - little known five years ago - will become an increasingly important part of the fund management business. There are two main reasons why transition management has emerged as a significant constituent of the investment business. One is the dramatic rise in the number of pension funds altering their portfolio - either because they have changed their fund manager after a period of underperformance or because they have restructured the fund for actuarial reasons. In a survey, Russell Mellon CAPS, a US consultancy, found that 2000 and 2001 saw the highest number of portfolio changes over the past 10 years, with nearly a quarter of all funds in the UK reporting some changes. This compares with just 12 per cent of funds altering their portfolios in 1992. The other reason is the growing awareness of the costs of buying and selling assets. Last year, Paul Myners, former chairman of Gartmore, the US-owned fund manager, wrote a UK government-backed report urging pension trustees to take a greater interest in these costs. There are essentially three costs: trading costs; ""market impact"" costs: when traders hear that one investor is planning to sell or buy a large quantity of equities or bonds, which will affect prices; ""implementation shortfall"" costs: the loss incurred by not owning what you want to own. It is t he transition managers' job to lower these costs. One way this is done is through so-called ""crossing"" - where buyers buyers and sellers are brought together without having to enter the market - a popular strat-egy. Special networks, such as E-Crossnet, have been established by fund managers to help them implement this. ""Crossing is a powerful trading method for cost saving during a transition as it avoids spread and market impact costs,"" says Paul Samuel, head of the transition management business at Barclays Global Investors. In a recent case, BGI had to move 900 stock holdings across 15 markets for a large European pension fund. The value of the assets was EUR700m (GBP446m). ""Of the amount, 41 per cent was crossed over a three-week period, creating savings worth EUR2.3m,"" Mr Samuel said. Tran sition managers say they do more than just reduce costs. They take charge of the whole project, in an effort to minimise risks. Much of this is laborious administrative work, but getting it right is important. If there are operational errors, then the cost is covered by the transition manager. All this means that pension funds are increasingly turning to transition managers, says Craig Niven, managing director for programme trading and transitions business at Morgan Stanley. There is no reliable estimate of the size of the market, although there is a consensus that it has grown sharply in recent years and is set to continue. BGI estimates the European transition market was worth GBP128bn last year, although others have put the figure nearer GBP200bn. It is difficult to gauge the size of the market because of the secrecy surrounding transaction deals. After all, most pension funds are reluctant to publish their holdings. The publicity for Boots' asset switch - and Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency's appointment of Morgan Stanley for its reallocation of EUR7bn of pension funds - was unusual. ""Secrecy is of utmost importance, and much of our business is done through the use of codewords,"" says Mr Samuel. It is widely believed that other pension funds are following Boots' example in hiring transition managers to manage their switch from equities to bonds: but the lips of the managers remain sealed. But there are other measures of the growth of the transition management business. ""The amounts quoted [for the size of the business] vary,"" says Michael Marks, managing director of transitions management at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, ""but the clearest sign of the growth is in the number of transitions we've managed. In 1993 we did the first one. Now, we can do 30-40 a year."" The business is getting more competitive - not least because there are more fund managers and dealer-brokers such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs offering a transition capability. Today there are over 20 transition specialists. One reason for this growth is that it is a lucrative business which can generate other income, such as from managing funds or trading. Some brokers do the transition business for free, but make money on the trading side. At times more explicit fees are charged, up to around five basis points of the value of the transition. But picking the best manager is not easy. Not all have the experience of handling very complex transactions, says Chris Milner, head of transition management at Goldman Sachs. ""Because not everyone in this area has the same experience managing projects, the selection of provider is as important as the decision to use a transition manager in order to avoid the extra risks."""

Only a fortnight ago Ecclestone was talking of offering the subscription service free to boost audience and revenue figures, in alarming decline because of the dull predictability of grand prix racing. His U-turn could throw the sport into a tailspin. Mr E - as he signs himself - has become Mr Angry. On Thursday he called off a pivotal meeting at DaimerChrysler's Stuttgart HQ. He had wanted to secure a deal with the big carmakers involved in F1, leading independent teams and the three banks - Bayerische Landesbank, JP Morgan and Lehmann Bros - stuck with failed media group Kirch's 75 per cent stake in the sport after lending Kirch a cool $1.6bn to buy it. But manufacturers - who are revving up plans to run a rival series - made it clear they would not agree. Observer this week ran into some of the Ford and Jaguar ""rebels"" who might otherwise have been in Stuttgart at a drinks do. ""We're bound to do the deal in the end; there's plenty of time,"" said one champagne-supping insider. No, there isn't. Mr E is giving them just a few weeks to climb aboard before he waves the chequered flag. Ski Boots John McGrath dragged himself away from the ski slopes on Sunday to fill in Observer on the latest wrinkle in the Boots succession saga. The sickly chemist's chairman said that he had simply decided it was time for his chief executive to move on - and then for him to follow. McGrath, who turns 65 in June, said he wanted to spend less time on business. ""I have always had a deal with my wife,"" explained the forthright former Diageo boss. ""I have spent the past 35 years travelling the world at her inconvenience."" McGrath said that when he handed over to his deputy Sir Nigel Rudd in the summer he would devote more time to the Dame Cicely Saunders palliative care hospice movement. There will also be more time to ski from his apartment in Klosters. On Sunday, he said, there was 180cm of fresh snow on the top slopes. But sadly no sunshine. Observer's heart bleeds. Grabiner Bros Former GUS man Ian Grabiner is feeling at home as he starts his first full week at the helm of Arcadia. Grabiner knows Philip Green's style well, having worked with him before - most notably at Amber Day and Sears. He says the billionaire has already made his mark on Arcadia. ""I keep going into obscure bits of the business which I think he won't have got to yet and they tell me they have already seen Philip,"" says Grabiner. Of course, there is another reason for Grabiner to feel at home. His cousin, Lord Grabiner QC, just happens to be Arcadia's chairman. Useful for the younger Grabiner, perhaps? ""Yes,"" jokes Ian. ""Particularly as he chairs the remuneration committee."" What price the chairman/chief executive split? Bigg shrug It's the time of year when analysts' minds turn to futurology. So far there has been a lot of fence-sitting going on. But the prize for honesty must go to Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, for admitting candidly: ""I have no idea what the coming year will be like."" Last year Biggs told the investment bank's clients that they were ""not out of the woods yet"". He wasn't wrong. Not much has changed, he reckons: we're ""still not out of the woods yet but there could be a clearing ahead"", if only because no developed stock market has gone down four years in a row (excepting Japan's after the second world war). After analysing the capital appreciation and total return from large and small US companies back to 1929, Biggs says there could be a 50 per cent rally next year. But then again, there might not. Wheeled out When David Arculus joined Emap in 1972 it was a small regional newspaper group with a few stolid magazine titles, such as Angling Times and Motorcycle News. His job was to lengthen the list and his proudest achievement was launching Smash Hits in 1978. ""That's the one I always like to talk about; it was the most tremendous success."" But which are the ones he'd rather not talk about? One flop that sticks in his mind is Women on Wheels, badly aimed at female bikers. ""I was very distant to that one,"" he grimaces. Brief relief There was relief all round that the Copenhagen summit ended more or less on time on Friday evening. But perhaps nobody was happier than Peter Medgyessy, Hungarian prime minister, who revealed that if the summit lasted more than five days he would run out of underwear.

Boots on Sunday admitted that a search had begun for a replacement for chief executive Steve Russell. It hopes to have a suitable candidate early next year. It also said that John McGrath, the chairman who joined the group from Diageo, would step down at the end of his contract in the summer after he had overseen the appointment of a new chief executive. Mr McGrath, who will be replaced by Sir Nigel Rudd, currently his deputy, said: ""We didn't act fast enough to really address the strategic issues facing Boots,"" pointing to the international and internet strategies. He said the group also over-sold the ""wellbeing"" concept - its health and beauty treatment centres which were Mr Russell's big idea for driving the business forward. ""Now we need to make a change of chief executive,"" added Mr McGrath. The latest moves mean that all the top jobs at Boots will have changed in less than a year. In March, the group replaced its long-standing finance director David Thompson. His successor, Howard Dodd, has already changed policy in a number of key accounting areas. Mr McGrath said that the moves were needed to accelerate change at Boots which faces constant competition from supermarkets. He said he wanted to find a new chief executive from outside Boots, but felt the group needed a retail expert. ""We need somebody with lots of drive and get up and go,"" he said. Retailers who have been linked with the Boots job include Stuart Rose of Arcadia, Tim Mason of Tesco and Sara Weller of J. Sainsbury. Mr McGrath insisted that he and Mr Russell had done a lot to improve Boots. ""The group that Steve and I inherited needed quite a lot of action,"" said Mr McGrath, pointing to a lack of investment in stores and information technology and a failure to give articulate a fresh strategic direction. Now, he said, much of that had been put right. Mr Russell - who has spent his whole career at Boots - will leave the group whenever a replacement is found. He is currently two and a half years away from group retirement age of 60. Mr McGrath insisted that the board was united on the issue of succession and denied that he was being pushed out. He said he had always planned just to serve one term as chairman before stepping back from the business world at the age of 65."

Is there a precedent in Tokyo's huge post-bubble slump since 1989? Or is this just a temporary weakness in a short-term cycle on the lines of the past behaviour of Wall Street, which accelerated strongly in the years after its 1990 low? That it is brave for individuals to make radical decisions is demonstrated by the departure of John Ralfe from Boots, the UK retail pharmacist chain. As head of corporate finance, he inspired the sale of Boots pension fund's equity assets, beginning in spring 2000, and its 100 per cent switch into long-term bonds. Boots' fund effectively captured and stabilised its surplus, while most similar pension schemes have watched their heavy equity weightings propel them into deficit. In October, Mr Ralfe collected an international award for European Pension Scheme of the Year on behalf of Boots. Within a few weeks, however, he was on his way. Although certain special factors apply - he apparently clashed with the new finance director - some general principles are relevant to this affair. The eternal rules of the behavioural framework were set out by John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 masterpiece The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Long-term investors, he said, need to be difficult people. They must be prepared to be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of people of average opinion. If such a person is successful, that may only serve to confirm the general belief in his rashness. Wild cards can come up trumps, given a streak of luck, but they are risky. Yet, if he is unsuccessful in the short run, as he may be even if he is fundamentally correct, Keynes warned, ""he will not receive much mercy"". This applied, of course, to Tony Dye who took extreme bets against the consensus when he was chief investment officer at Phillips &Drew. He believed that equities were hugely overvalued. But he was pushed out in March 2000, within a few days of the peak of the technology bubble. Subsequently, P&D's relative performance blossomed, but its creator had gone. Keynes pointed out that aggressive decision-makers are vulnerable whenever funds are controlled by committees or boards. The consensus view is tremendously powerful, however wrong it may be. Although Mr Ralfe was right, he is viewed by the pensions industry as lucky, but dangerous. Indeed, his strategy of not just switching to bonds but in fact abandoning conventional fund manager relationships - the Boots fund's assets are not managed, but are matched against liabilities - amounted to a direct attack on the pensions industry infrastructure, which consists of fund managers, asset consultants and securities dealers. Keynes summed up this situation in his famous aphorism: ""Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally."" So will today's consensus prove stabilising or damaging? Professional investors and pension scheme trustees are locked into the belief that the equity market will soon recover strongly. But is that view based on evidence, or is it simply wishful thinking inspired by the awareness that any other outcome would not allow the pension industry's survival to survive in anything like its present form? Sometimes, external forces can crack the consensus. Across Europe, the life assurance industry has been forced to dump equities because of the requirement to observe statutory or regulatory solvency limits. When solvency is under threat, there must be a retreat to safer assets. Occupational pension schemes in the Netherlands have also had tighter rules imposed on them, which may lead to a reduction in equity weightings. In the UK, however, solvency rules have, if anything, been relaxed. Such regulations are blunt weapons, which may encourage even more companies to terminate their defined benefit plans. Anyway, forced selling can be destabilising - as can be seen in the extraordinary weakness of the German equity market during the third quarter of this year. UK companies have been given a temporary deferral of the accounting standard FRS 17. So pension fund trustees continue to cling to the ideas and asset allocations of the golden years. They now rely, by implication, on a stock market rally to reduce or eliminate their deficits, followed perhaps by a slow rebalancing as the consensus adjusts to higher bond weightings."

Jointly presented by two of the liveliest and most serious theatre companies in Britain, Paines Plough and Graeae, and running at one of London's most valuable homes of new writing, the Bush Theatre, it keeps us in suspense not just about what will happen but about much more: who these characters are, and what kind of play this is. It is also poetic, and imaginative. Is this a science-fiction story about oppression and killing in another world? A re-telling of the plight of Jews kept hidden in Nazi Germany in metaphorical terms? A grim fantasy of a society where appearance matters more than moral values? Or a world where people look like some Dorian Gray mirror image of them? Are these two women alter egos or opposites? Are their two men their lovers, their enemies, their inferiors? Seamlessly, its characters keep turning away from the action to describe their feelings; and, though there are only four people on stage, we're well over halfway through the play until we begin to grasp how they are connected. It's too obscure at times, to be sure, yet it keeps drawing us back. The play has scarcely begun than there's one mysterious stabbing; and as it reaches its conclusion, there's one murder, then another killing, and finally another character's wilful but vain search for death. Two other characters are stuck in a life where appearances matter too much - and the two characters whom we never expected to connect are lyrically, joyfully, united in a death where appearances matter no more. I kept finding the play rather too fancy, too arch, and yet I'm glad to have seen it. It's very good to see and hear young writers tackling so many layers of what a play can do. It must be exceptionally difficult to act, and yet its director, Vicky Featherstone, who has worked with Owen before, and its designer, Neil Warmington, have chosen to make it more obscure yet. Why are there lilies and dahlias in a fishtank at the back? And why toy bunnies and flowers on an artificial lawn? And why are the four characters dressed with even-handed ugliness? The boots, mini-skirt, and blouse that ""radiant"" Tara wears are worse than naff. The four actors - Neil McKinven, Josephine Butler, and, especially, Eileen Walsh and Theo Fraser Steele - cast all the light they can.

Nor does the ability to listen to authority figures. The Takeover Panel on Tuesday publicly censured both Mr Bonnier and Indigo for their behaviour since January 7, when the company became subject to the takeover code by announcing it was considering a bid for Regus, the office services business. The language used by the panel may sound mild - Mr Bonnier and Indigo are ""hereby criticised"" for conduct falling ""well short of the standards required of parties in takeovers"" - but this is the strongest action the panel can take short of a call (extremely rare) for the City to cold-shoulder a party, and the censure is thoroughly deserved. It is a fundamental panel rule, designed to prevent false markets, that dealings by a bidder in the shares of a target company must be publicly disclosed by the following day. But on six occasions Indigo failed to do so, and three of the rule breaches are particularly bad. Mr Bonnier twice bought parcels of shares in Regus in direct contravention of panel instructions that it must clear dealings in advance. He appears to have been attempting to rectify an inaccurate statement given to the market, declaring that Indigo held Regus shares when in fact it owned none. The third deal involved the closing out of a contract for difference, which the panel regards as equivalent to a sale of shares. And before selling shares in a target, a predator must both warn the market and get the approval of the panel. Indigo did neither. Its immediate punishment is that it will not be allowed to buy any more shares in Regus or exercise a right to take ownership of a near-13 per cent stake tied up in contracts for difference. But since Regus cannot be taken over without the approval of Mark Dixon, chief executive and holder of 63 per cent of the shares, this may not matter too much. Despite Mr Bonnier's apology to the panel, after this fiasco few will regard Indigo as a serious bidder or will take anything it says on trust. The panel has done its job in maintaining the rules of the takeover game. The focus now passes to the Financial Services Authority, which was already investigating whether pre-January 7 statements by Indigo might have created a ""false and misleading"" impression in the market. It will doubtless study the panel's statement carefully. If it uncovers actions that are sinister rather than stupid, it should crack down hard. Boots Boots' Wellbeing division is growing, but the group's sense of wellbeing is not. The health and beauty retailer could be forgiven for wincing on Tuesday as its best third-quarter sales performance for more than 10 years was greeted with a share price drop on margin concerns. Even after Tuesday's fall, the share price has outperformed the FTSE general retail sector by more than 10 per cent in the past year. But it does not feel like that. One reason is the wealth of unknown factors. Like all retailers, Boots will have to cope with uncertainties about consumer demand. It must also deal with the aftermath of last week's Office of Fair Trading report on liberalising the pharmacy market. Moreover, Boots also awaits a new chief executive. His or her decisions will be critical. What about the future of Wellbeing, where disappointing trading has led to speculation that it might be closed? What about Boots Healthcare International, which some analysts say should be expanded through acquisitions and others say should be shut? What product mix makes sense in the high street throughout the year? What will be the engine of growth going forward? The wide range of possible answers can make for an entertaining game of Fantasy Business, but is less than ideal for running the group in the meantime. Nor is it much of a basis for making investment decisions. The range of analysts' forecasts for this year slightly narrowed yesterday. Most are now in the GBP585m-GBP600m range, giving a multiple of little more than 11 times. Only a new chief executive is likely to give that rating a shot in the arm. Reckitt Despite evidence that most takeovers destroy value, few chief executives can resist the thrill of the chase and many end up overpaying. Not so Bart Becht, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, who on Tuesday reinforced his reputation for prudence by losing out to Energizer of the US in Pfizer's auction of the Schick-Wilkinson Sword razors business. Energizer stumped up a higher-than-expected $930m (GBP596m). The outcome is something of a relief to the market, with the added bonus that it substantially increases the chance of a dividend boost or share buy-back announcement on February 19, when the company unveils its 2002 preliminary results.

The language used by the panel may sound mild - Mr Bonnier and Indigo are ""hereby criticised"" for conduct falling ""well short of the standards required of parties in takeovers"" - but this is the strongest action the panel can take short of a call (extremely rare) for the City to cold-shoulder a party, and the censure is thoroughly deserved. It is a fundamental panel rule, designed to prevent false markets, that dealings by a bidder in the shares of a target company must be publicly disclosed by the following day. But on six occasions Indigo failed to do so, and three of the rule breaches are particularly bad. Mr Bonnier twice bought parcels of shares in Regus in direct contravention of panel instructions that it must clear dealings in advance. He appears to have been attempting to rectify an inaccurate statement given to the market, declaring that Indigo held Regus shares when in fact it owned none. The third deal involved the closing out of a contract for difference, which the panel regards as equivalent to a sale of shares. And before selling shares in a target, a predator must both warn the market and get the approval of the panel. Indigo did neither. Its immediate punishment is that it will not be allowed to buy any more shares in Regus or exercise a right to take ownership of a near-13 per cent stake tied up in contracts for difference. But since Regus cannot be taken over without the approval of Mark Dixon, chief executive and holder of 63 per cent of the shares, this may not matter too much. Despite Mr Bonnier's apology to the panel, after this fiasco few will regard Indigo as a serious bidder or will take anything it says on trust. The panel has done its job in maintaining the rules of the takeover game. The focus now passes to the Financial Services Authority, which was already investigating whether pre-January 7 statements by Indigo might have created a ""false and misleading"" impression in the market. It will doubtless study the panel's statement carefully. If it uncovers actions that are sinister rather than stupid, it should crack down hard. Boots Boots' Wellbeing division is growing, but the group's sense of wellbeing is not. The health and beauty retailer could be forgiven for wincing on Tuesday as its best third-quarter sales performance for more than 10 years was greeted with a share price drop on margin concerns. Even after Tuesday's fall, the share price has outperformed the FTSE general retail sector by more than 10 per cent in the past year. But it does not feel like that. One reason is the wealth of unknown factors. Like all retailers, Boots will have to cope with uncertainties about consumer demand. It must also deal with the aftermath of last week's Office of Fair Trading report on liberalising the pharmacy market. Moreover, Boots also awaits a new chief executive. His or her decisions will be critical. What about the future of Wellbeing, where disappointing trading has led to speculation that it might be closed? What about Boots Healthcare International, which some analysts say should be expanded through acquisitions and others say should be shut? What product mix makes sense in the high street throughout the year? What will be the engine of growth going forward? The wide range of possible answers can make for an entertaining game of Fantasy Business, but is less than ideal for running the group in the meantime. Nor is it much of a basis for making investment decisions. The range of analysts' forecasts for this year slightly narrowed yesterday. Most are now in the GBP585m-GBP600m range, giving a multiple of little more than 11 times. Only a new chief executive is likely to give that rating a shot in the arm. Reckitt Despite evidence that most takeovers destroy value, few chief executives can resist the thrill of the chase and many end up overpaying. Not so Bart Becht, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, who on Tuesday reinforced his reputation for prudence by losing out to Energizer of the US in Pfizer's auction of the Schick-Wilkinson Sword razors business. Energizer stumped up a higher-than-expected $930m (GBP596m). The outcome is something of a relief to the market, with the added bonus that it substantially increases the chance of a dividend boost or share buy-back announcement on February 19, when the company unveils its 2002 preliminary results.

But how do you stop it happening? This week has brought forth two possible solutions. Archie Norman, the former Asda boss and Conservative MP, proposes legislation obliging boards to take into account the performance of an executive when determining the size of a severance package. Good though it is that a businessman as prominent as Mr Norman regards ""payment for failure"" as ""undermining the credibility of the market"", his solution is not the best around. That honour goes to an initiative Thursday by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds (nice, by the way, to see them working together). They unveiled a non-statutory code of best practice that they will police, and the fact that shareholders will get the right to vote on pay from next year gives them some muscle. If the system can be made to work it is better than legislation because that tends to be over-rigid, unable to respond quickly to changes in practice. And where big money is involved, people can be extremely creative with loopholes. The details of the institutions' code are as sensible as their general approach. They want boards to take full account of severance costs when they draw up contracts (which few seem to do now) and consider clauses that would stop compensation when dismissal is for financial failure - though defining that may be harder to do. They support the idea that severance payments should be phased over time and stop when the executive finds new employment. They want companies to stop giving unjustified pensions boosts to ousted executives - an area on which there has been too little focus until now. And, controversially, they suggest contracts could be set for less than the standard 12 months. However, even if companies comply, this will be no overnight revolution: the institutions cannot expect existing contracts to be summarily rewritten. But from the start the code might give shareholders greater powers of moral pressure to limit the size of payments for failure, even where these are contractually watertight. An interesting test case could be looming at Cable and Wireless, where Graham Wallace, the chief executive, could have the right to a GBP2m pay-off if ousted. The boot at Boots Boots is not a company in obvious crisis, so why is it evidently preparing to replace Steve Russell, its chief executive? Headhunters are looking for someone new. Since Mr Russell's appointment two-and-a-half years ago, Boots' shares have not performed badly, holding their own against the general retailing sector. But the company has failed to convince the City that it has a particularly rosy future. Mr Russell is not a natural or inspired communicator and board members, particularly John McGrath, the chairman, appear to be losing patience. Presentation skills apart, there is concern that he has not been driving the business sufficiently hard, fast or tightly at a time when it faces huge challenges. Its retailing business is under siege from the supermarkets (Tesco is now the leading retailer of health and beauty products by volume) while an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading into the allocation of pharmacy licences could increase competition and hit its sales and margins. He has, it is true, replaced a substantial number of senior managers and last summer assumed more power over retailing, where he has considerable strengths. But his critics inside and outside the company say he is too nice a man, lacking the ruthless streak needed to give Boots the shake-up it needs. And like so many of Boots' managers, he is deficient in entrepreneurial flair. Nor have his strategic initiatives gone down very well in the City. Several have been abandoned, including plans for a chain of free-standing cosmetics stores. His big idea, a move into ""wellbeing"" areas, such as dentistry and chiropody, could bear fruit down the road - particularly if a shake-up in the National Health Service gave Boots a role in simple medical procedures - but for now it is unproven and draining cash. In fairness, he inherited a lousy hand. Under his predecessor, James (now Lord) Blyth, Boots embarked on costly and foolish acquisitions (such as Halfords, the car parts retailer) outside its core area of competence in an attempt to escape the maturity of the chemists' market. It also grossly underinvested in information technology and its stores - failures that have come back to haunt Mr Russell. With the benefit of hindsight, he would have done better to have made a dramatic splash on his appointment, renouncing the legacy of Lord Blyth, wielding the axe and kitchen sinking. But it is hard to do that when you are a Boots lifer (he joined the company in 1967) and still beholden to your predecessor (if not actually frightened of him). Such radical change is always easier for an outsider to achieve, as time may show. Martin.Dickson@ft.com."

The move to end the trial of such treatments as reflexology, homeopathy, herbalism and aromatherapy - part of Boots' Wellbeing health services business - means that almost all the initiatives put in place since Mr Russell became chief executive nearly three years ago have been scrapped. Boots, which is in the process of finding a replacement for Mr Russell and John McGrath, chairman, said the Wellbeing move, along with changes to its dentalcare offer, would result in annual savings of GBP4m - after costs of GBP4m over two years. The alternative treatments were being offered in 12 Boots stores but failed to attract enough customers. The group said it would continue its trial of some other treatments such as massage and facials, as well as its more mainstream dental, optical and chiropody services. However, after difficulties attracting and retaining dentists, Boots is moving to self-employed contracts and changing its management structures. Boots has had a turbulent start to 2003, facing criticism for continuing to make strategic and personnel changes before appointing new senior management. The group announced relatively strong Christmas trading, albeit at the cost of a hit to the gross margin of more than 1 percentage point. Boots has been hit by news that the Office of Fair Trading is recommending deregulation of controls on pharmacy licences, which would let supermarkets enter its core territory. J. Sainsbury announced last week it was axing the Boots store-within-a-store trial - something Mr Russell had held out as the way forward for the group's out-of-town retailing ambitions. The Sainsbury move followed a series of senior departures from Boots management team. Shares in Boots fell 10p to 540p."
"Factiva-20230329-1438 (2).rtf","Document ftcom00020030329dz3o00002","24 March 2003","Risk management - Dilemma over pension fund deficits.","927 words","It would be nice if all a company had to worry about was operational matters such as meeting production targets, delivering a product that customers want and controlling costs. But sophisticated financial markets ensure that companies have a lot more issues to consider. Since the advent of floating exchange rates in the 1970s and the volatility of interest rates in the 1980s and 1990s, executives have had to grapple with risks that are beyond their control. Currency movements pose three potential threats for companies. The first is transaction risk - the danger that a shift in exchange rates makes a particular deal unprofitable. For example, a euro-based company could quote a price in dollars, only to find that the dollar falls before it has delivered the goods. Its costs in euros would not have fallen; its revenues in dollars would have done. The second threat is translation risk, the danger that the earnings of an overseas subsidiary will be lower, when translated into the home currency. The third threat is economic risk, the danger that currency movements will make a company's goods and services uncompetitive. It is generally agreed that it is both easy and sensible to hedge transaction risk, but the benefits of hedging against the other two risks are less clear. With transaction risk there is a clear cash element - so it makes sense to incur a cash cost to hedge it. Unless the overseas subsidiary is remitting dividends, there is no cash element to translation risk. Economic risk, while undeniably real, is very difficult to estimate and so is hard to hedge. For companies that do try to hedge, there are plenty of instruments available. Future foreign exchange receipts can be sold in the forward market; the same effect can also be achieved through currency futures. Both approaches ""lock in"" a given exchange rate and do not allow the company to benefit if currencies move in a favourable direction. The use of options, however, gives a company flexibility. The option guarantees a set exchange rate; if the company can get a better rate in the market, it can let the option lapse. The only cost is the premium. Interest rate movements also pose a potential danger for companies. Should they borrow at a fixed rate and risk a general fall in rates? Or should they borrow at a floating rate and risk a rise? The existence of the swaps market has made these risks, in theory, much easier to handle. A company can borrow in the form it finds easiest, or cheapest, whether it is fixed or floating rate, domestic or foreign currency. It can then use the swaps market to adjust those borrowings in the light of its interest rate views. Companies have been grappling with these exchange and interest rate risks for 30 years now, and the tools available to manage the dangers have become familiar. Recent attention has focused on a risk that is just as old, but has been less well monitored - the pension fund. Businesses in the US, UK and the Netherlands have made promises to their employees to provide them with an income in their retirement, based on their final salaries. These promises have steadily become more expensive over the years, thanks to increased longevity, improved benefits and lower bond yields. For a long time, companies regarded this increased cost with equanimity, thanks to the long bull market in equities - and many companies were able to take contribution holidays during the period. But the past three years of falling share prices have brought home the risks companies were taking with their heavy equity weightings. Financial economists generally agree that a pension promise to make a series of regular payments is a bond-like liability. That suggests companies should match the liability by owning government or corporate bonds. Critics argue that pension funds' historic exposure to equities has accordingly been an unacceptable risk. Had executives asked permission from shareholders to borrow money on the capital markets and invest the proceeds in equities, they would have been turned down. Such a gamble should not be allowed merely because it is hidden within a pension fund. Moving the portfolio entirely into bonds, however, is quite expensive. If one assumes - as actuaries tend to - that equities will outperform bonds over the longer term, a bond-only portfolio will require higher contributions from the sponsoring company. In the UK, Boots, the retail chain, managed to switch its portfolio from equities into bonds in 2000, when the cost was much lower; few companies are willing to make that switch today. The result is that many companies are left with big deficits. That means they are committed to making significant contributions for the foreseeable future. That cost can be reduced a little over the long term (by, for example, closing schemes to new members). But most companies seem to be hoping that a rebound in the equity market will fill the gap. This issue is becoming all the more significant with the introduction of new accountancy standards, such as the UK's FRS 17, which bring the deficits on to the balance sheet. An international standard along similar lines is expected to be unveiled in 2005. Where the deficit is large, relative to the company, financial markets have become understandably concerned. Credit rating agencies are treating the deficits as debt and downgrading the companies accordingly. Pension fund risk could be one of the biggest issues facing the corporate sector in the next few years."
"Factiva-20230329-1438 (2).rtf","Document ftcom00020030324dz3n000cw","23 March 2003","From Vietnam to Iraq.","2,945 words","As dawn broke on January 10 1968, a US reconnaissance platoon headed out from its base in Binh Phouc, a small village in Vietnam's Mekong delta, on a ""search and destroy"" mission into the countryside. After a few hours on patrol, the soldiers came across a group of bunkers, perhaps a day or two old, and freshly painted signs reading Tu Dia - a warning to locals that Viet Cong forces had planted landmines. The platoon destroyed eight of the bunkers and then withdrew, asking Specialist Gary Parker, the artilleryman serving as a forward observer, to order in an artillery strike. The measure was to ensure that any remaining explosives were also detonated. The fire direction officer back at artillery battery B was 2nd Lieutenant Tommy R. Franks, a tall, lanky Texan who had been sent to Binh Phouc just a few months earlier, having graduated from artillery officer candidate school at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. ""He was a 22-year-old, big ol' country kid with a chaw of tobacco in his cheeks,"" recalls Charlie Taylor, who served with Lt Franks in the 5th battalion. Specialist Parker radioed the co-ordinates for the strike and Lt Franks checked his map. The closest hamlets were more than 900 metres away and the area was marked ""safe for observed fire"". As the recon platoon pulled out, white phosphorus was fired, casting a bright, ghostly light over the ground. Specialist Parker took another look back under the glowing luminescence and decided to radio in a correction to the co-ordinates. Lt Franks checked his map again and asked if another white phosphorus round should be fired. The forward observer said No but changed the co-ordinates yet again. After a final check of the map, Lt Franks ordered his first battery to fire. The round took off with a thud, arced through the sky - and tore through the roof of a Vietnamese family's hut. The explosion killed Le Thi Dep, a 27-year-old woman, and two boys, Bui Van Chay, aged four, and Bui Van Chan, 12. Three other children were wounded: eight-year-old Bui Thi Chon and two girls, Bui Thi Ton, 13, and Bui Van Cu, 10. The retreating platoon did not learn of the civilian casualties until villagers ran to their base and a helicopter was ordered in to evacuate the wounded. An investigation found that Specialist Parker had attempted to put the round into the tree line but his correction after the phosphorus flare put the round 100m to 125m into the open. ""The investigation reveals that there were no errors or mistakes on the part of the fire direction centre or howitzer section,"" the commanding officer concluded. ""The error was poor judgment on the part of the forward observer."" Today Lt Franks is a four-star general, commanding the vast array of soldiers and weaponry engulfing Iraq, mile by mile. But like many officers of his generation, especially in the army, Gen Franks appears to have taken the lessons of Vietnam to heart. Foremost among these is the impact civilian casualties - particularly those broadcast to living rooms back home - can have on domestic and international support for a war. ""The nature of war is that non-combatants are injured and killed,"" Gen Franks said at his first press conference of operation Iraqi Freedom at the weekend. ""That's why the members of this coalition go to extraordinary lengths in order to be able to be precise in our targeting."" It has been a long, occasionally difficult rise for Gen Franks from the marshes of the Mekong delta to commander of all US forces in the 25 Middle Eastern and central Asian countries that are part of US Central Command. Unlike most army brass who rise to their fourth star, Gen Franks is not a graduate of one of a small group of prestigious military schools, which has at its pinnacle the US Military Academy at West Point. Instead, he was commissioned having been through officer candidate school (OCS) in 1967. ""It's unheard-of for an OCS guy,"" says one retired officer who served with Gen Franks. ""It's very hard to survive the West Point Protection Association. They all watch each other's backs."" Indeed, Gen Franks was a college drop-out when he joined the army in 1965, leaving the University of Texas at the age of 20 to enlist as a private. His father, a mechanic, had moved his family from Wynnewood, Oklahoma, to Midland, Texas, when Tommy was an infant. His academic career was undistinguished - except for graduating from Midland Lee High School a year ahead of one Laura Welch, who would go on to marry the scion of a prominent local political family. Much like the president, Gen Franks likes to maintain an image of the small-town Texan, preferring country music, hunting and motorcycles to the highbrow pursuits favoured by some of the newer army leaders such as General John Keane, the odds-on favourite to be the next army chief of staff. ""Jack Keane likes to go to the opera,"" says a former senior Pentagon official who worked with both during the Clinton administration. ""Tommy Franks doesn't know how to spell 'opera'."" But underneath, former colleagues say, are a sharp mind and an ambition that belie his humble exterior. ""The 'I'm the old bumpkin from Texas' act is not true,"" says retired General David Ohle, who worked closely with Gen Franks when both were aides to the army chief of staff in the early 1990s. Even during his 14 months in Vietnam, veterans remember, the young 2nd lieutenant stood out from other grunts, spending time with light infantrymen and mechanised battalions to understand how each trained and fought. ""A lot of artillery guys would just sit back and plot the fire support,"" says William Doherty, who shared a bunk with Lt Franks in a small, four-officer barracks for three months at Binh Phouc. ""This guy wanted to get involved."" Charlie Taylor adds: ""A lot of guys I served with said, 'I'm here to put in my time and get out of here'. Tommy was here to fight the war."" The ambition Gen Franks developed in Vietnam did not leave him when he returned to Fort Sill to command a cannon battery. He married Cathy - whom he had met and become engaged to before shipping out - and told her he was going to leave the military to get his college degree. In an effort to keep him, the army offered to put him through its ""boot strap degree completion programme""; but army life was becoming increasingly difficult. The shadow of Vietnam was growing by the day and many of his comrades were leaving. He decided to get his degree at the University of Texas through the programme but, by the time he left for Germany as a captain, things were only getting harder. ""I had a number of friends who left the profession for what seemed to me, quite candidly, perfectly good reasons,"" Gen Franks once told an interviewer. ""It was not an outfit that we really just enjoyed going to work in every day."" He would return to the US for his first posting at the Pentagon, working for the army chief of staff in 1977, and for the next 13 years he slowly climbed the army's career ladder. By the time Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he had earned his first star, a brigadier general with 1st Cavalry Division, the shield of which he still wears on his shoulder patch. As an assistant division commander for the ""First Team"", as the 1st Cavalry is known, Gen Franks had been given the responsibility for the division's manoeuvres - a fortuitous assignment, since the 1st Cav did a lot of manoeuvring during the 1991 Gulf war and little else. In the weeks following the Iraqi invasion, the 1st Cav was the first heavy army division ordered into Saudi Arabia to block any Iraqi attempt to add to its gains in Kuwait. It was eventually positioned on the Wadi al Batin, a broad plain where Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq intersect. Once there, the division was assigned the mission of being a deception force, feinting into Iraq periodically while the US and British armies amassed to the west. The strategy worked as planned, culminating in what would come to be known as General Norman Schwarzkopf's famous ""left hook"", as four armoured divisions moved north into the empty Iraqi desert and took Mr Hussein's army by surprise by turning east and attacking it from the side. ""Sun Tzu said 2,500 years ago, 'Make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots',"" Gen Franks later wrote. ""That's what the campaign plan called for and that's exactly what we did. It was a masterstroke."" But the 1st Cav's most impressive feat during the 1991 Gulf war came after it had succeeded in duping the Iraqis. Convinced the Iraqi army was being routed, Gen Schwarzkopf ordered the 1st Cav to enter the fray. It broke contact with enemy forces, moved north almost 180 miles, refuelled and linked up with the 1st Armoured Division in less than 24 hours. It was about to attack Basra when the ceasefire was announced. Gen Franks emerged from Desert Storm as a minor star. ""You can't say he was a diamond in the rough out of an officer rank of 90,000,"" says retired General Theodore Stroup, who was the personnel chief for General Gordon Sullivan, the army chief of staff after the Gulf war. ""Senior officers talk, though. These young priests are brought along by their bishops and cardinals; and he was seen as a young, forward-looking officer."" Gen Sullivan became Gen Franks's cardinal, picking him for a special assignment that the chief of staff believed was critical to the future of the army: adapting it to the digital world. Gen Sullivan understood that the Gulf war had shown that the US army, for 50 years preparing for another European ground war, was too big and too slow to deploy to the world's hot spots. He wanted to use emerging technologies to make the army quicker and more efficient and he selected his new young star to head his initiative. It was an odd choice. Gen Franks is to this day viewed as part of the army's old school, bound in cold-war-era traditions and doctrines. But those who served with him at the time said he was a perfect match for the job. ""These were forward-thinkers but not eggheads,"" says Gen Stroup. ""They were still muddy-boots guys."" The army, as always, was reluctant to change its ways but Gen Sullivan made the project a priority and Gen Franks became well known among the most senior officers, briefing them about the programme's progress. ""What he did in Desert Storm, that was important,"" says Gen Ohle. ""But there were a lot of assistant division commanders in Desert Storm and there were a lot of artillerymen. In this job he met with every general - and the board of directors was all made of four-stars. He had been set apart and given one of the hardest and most ambiguous jobs in the army and he excelled."" From there, Gen Franks's career rocketed. He obtained his first division command post in South Korea, where he got his second star heading the Seoul-based 2nd Infantry Division. Then - a rarity - he was granted another division command, heading the 3rd army, where he oversaw all army forces assigned to US Central Command. When Gen Franks arrived at Centcom, the commander-in-chief, or ""Cinc"" as it was called, was General Anthony Zinni, a short, burly city boy from Philadelphia whose intellect was well known and respected and who liked to read poetry and Islamic history. Despite the contrast, the two men, by most accounts, got on well. Gen Franks learnt about the region and how the Cincdom - as the 25 countries under the Centcom purview were known - required a diplomat as much as a warrior. Gen Franks helped prepare for another ground war with Iraq - still regarded as the most likely conflict - reforming the Kuwaiti military so it could defend itself until US reinforcements arrived. When Gen Zinni's time in command was up in 1999, he made a strong recommendation that Gen Franks be his successor. When the two aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11 2001, Gen Franks was asleep in a hotel in Crete, on his way to Pakistan. That morning, according to one account, he and his wife had gone shopping for souvenirs, then returned to their hotel to rest.* Gen Frank's aides were watching CNN and, when the second aircraft hit, one ran up to his room to wake him. As they watched the buildings collapse on television, Gen Franks uttered three initials: UBL, the government's shorthand for Osama bin Laden. Since then, Gen Franks's tenure as commander of Centcom has been mixed. He was picked for his proficiency as a traditional battlefield commander. But on the insistence of Donald Rumsfeld, defence secretary, the war in Afghanistan and the conflict in Iraq have relied heavily on air power and special forces. According to several accounts, the first war plan Gen Franks presented to Mr Rumsfeld looked very like the strategy successfully used in the first Gulf war, with four to five heavy army divisions moving deliberately through the desert before taking Baghdad. Mr Rumsfeld sent the plan back two or three times for revision. On paper, the forces now deployed against Mr Hussein - 250,000 troops in and around Iraq - appear to be close to what Gen Franks originally ordered. In fact, there is only one heavy US army division, the 3rd Infantry, involved in the invasion. The only other heavy armour is the UK's 7th armoured brigade. The rest are marines and light infantry, lots of air power and thousands of special forces. ""What Rumsfeld and Franks don't like about each other is that they're a mirror image,"" says Loren Thompson, a military analyst with the Lexington Institute. ""Rumsfeld probably thinks that Franks is unimaginative and Franks probably thinks Rumsfeld is unrealistic."" In addition, Mr Rumsfeld has, in some ways, singled out Gen Franks's army for particularly tough treatment. The only big weapons system the defence secretary has retired is the Crusader, a 40-ton battlefield cannon which he regarded as the epitome of the old, slow-moving army. Gen Franks strongly backed the system during his confirmation hearing in 2000. Despite Gen Franks's reputation as an innovator, other services under his command, particularly some officers in the air force, grumble that he does not fully understand the transforming abilities of precision air strikes. Those close to the air force say it is no co-incidence that the two air force generals who helped run the air campaign in Afghanistan - David Deptula and Charles Wald - are no longer part of Central Command, having frequently clashed with Gen Franks. ""A lot of senior military in the Pentagon, particularly at the air force, don't have a lot of confidence in him [Franks],"" says one retired officer with close ties to the Pentagon. ""The air force commanders were fit to be tied [frustrated] during Afghanistan. A lot of air force people thought they missed a lot of targets early on."" Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders are believed to have escaped from Tora Bora en masse during the US-led assault. Operation Anaconda, the other main battle, was similarly unable to capture or kill large numbers of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. ""If you look at Tora Bora and Anaconda, you have the same leaders making the decisions now [who] did in that debacle,"" says one former officer who is in frequent contact with air force brass. The decision last month to name General John Abizaid, the Harvard-educated Arabist who is considered the fastest-rising star in the army, as one of Gen Franks's Centcom deputies was rumoured to be a move to insert a more free-thinking officer into the command - an assertion Mr Rumsfeld has dismissed as ""hogwash"". There have also been rumblings of poor morale at Centcom. One former government official tells a story about MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, home to both Centcom and Special Operations Command, or Socom. Those who have visited MacDill say Socom is known as ""Happy-com"" and Centcom is known as ""Sad-com"" because of the way Gen Franks treats subordinates. Indeed, the recent complaint filed against Gen Franks, in which a subordinate accused him of violating security procedures by allowing his wife to sit in on top-secret meetings, is believed to have stemmed from pockets of disgruntlement among Centcom's ranks. Yet those close to Gen Franks maintain that his hard-driving style and occasional rough treatment of those around him are the traits that make him an effective leader. ""There are people who love to work for you because you're hard,"" says Gen Ohle. ""Some people aren't used to the pressure that Tommy brings. His bar is set higher than most."" Faced with widespread international opposition to the war in Iraq, and under political pressure to secure an almost flawless victory, Gen Franks will have to set that bar higher still. * The Mission: waging war and keeping peace with America's military (Norton, February 2003)."

Mr Ralfe, who left the chemist chain late last year, will seek to advise companies on managing the risks arising from their pension funds. The Boots pension fund switch into bonds, announced in 2001, triggered an intense debate about the suitability of equities as an investment for other schemes. Falling equity markets have seen most UK pension funds fall deeply into deficit. Mr Ralfe warned that the problems of corporate pension funds are likely to worsen. ""If we think things are bad now with pensions, we have not seen anything yet,"" he said in his first interview since leaving Boots. ""It is only a matter of time before we see a company with tens of thousands of employees go bust. We will then see quite a lot of those people not get the sort of pensions that they were expecting."" Mr Ralfe said neither the Department of Work and Pensions nor the Treasury realise the severity of the pension problem. ""I don't think they have a contingency plan,"" he said. ""What will they do if a company with 50,000 members goes bust and there is a deficit on the fund? Since we have not had to grapple with this yet, the problem has not been on the political agenda but it will be when you have 20,000 people marching up and down Whitehall and not 200 people."" He added: ""The pensions act and framework for security that has been put in place is notoriously weak and it was set up to fail."" Mr Ralfe said his eponymous consulting company will take a different tack to traditional actuarial firms that focus on pension funds and their trustees. ""We will look at pension funds fairly and squarely as part of a company's overall operations - how they fit into its capital structure, level of debt and appetite for risk,"" he said. While a passionate agitator for bond investment by pension funds, Mr Ralfe said it would not be appropriate for all companies to adopt the Boots strategy of exiting completely out of equities. Mr Ralfe came to Boots in 1991 after a career largely spent advising corporates on debt. He worked at Chase Manhattan, SG Warburg and Swiss Bank on syndicated debt offerings and advising companies on restructuring borrowings. He then founded and headed a debt and treasury advisory service for Ernst &Young."

Rogue outsider, an evangelist driven by dangerous ideology and the bete noire of equities are among the labels critics have sought to pin on him. And small wonder - for in delivering a body blow to the decades-old status quo that said pension funds should invest a large chunk of their money in shares he has upset more than a few vested interests. But as falling equity markets have driven pension funds around the world deeply into the red, Mr Ralfe has found more than a little vindication for leading what is now seen as a landmark move by a pension fund to switch completely out of shares. ""The hidden risks that most pension funds were taking have been largely exposed,"" he says in his first interview since leaving Boots, the conservative chemists' chain whose pension fund started its move into bonds in April 2000. For much of the past 30 years, investment strategy in the once sleepy world of pensions was straightforward for most companies: put the money into equities. The conventional wisdom was that pensions are long-term investments and, over the long term, equities outperform. This would allow companies to reduce the cost of providing pensions and increase benefits for members. In a rising market, there seemed little need to question the approach and any short-term blips could be smoothed out through opaque valuations performed by actuaries. But Boots' move was a direct challenge to the equity orthodoxy and sparked an intense debate on how suitable shares are as a haven for pension funds' money. It showed there was another way - and did so just as share prices entered a three-year tailspin and the controversial new UK accounting standard FRS17 forced companies to take regular snapshots of the current market value of their pension funds. Mr Ralfe says the Boots switch was driven by a belief, backed by growing opinion among academics and younger, ""modernising"" actuaries, that bonds are the closest match to a pension fund's liabil-ities - the retirement income it has to pay out to members. The issue is that along with their outperformance, equities bring an increased risk that the assets at any particular moment will not be able to cover the liabilities. For companies where the pension fund is large compared with their market capitalisation or profits, this risk is significant and is taken in an area where most businesses do not have a competitive advantage: asset management. Mr Ralfe says these risks have largely been overlooked by shareholders, managements and pension fund trustees, pensions somehow being seen as a separate appendage to the company, rather than as an integral part of its capital structure. Some companies were ""unconsciously"" structured in effect like unbalanced hedge funds, betting heavily on equities. ""Pensions should not be a vehicle for rolling the dice,"" he says. ""I am not against holding equities. But if the company pension scheme holds equity, it is not really doing anything that the individual shareholder can't do. So if there is a free ride [the benefits of equity outperformance], it is for the private shareholder to do that by holding shares."" Mr Ralfe says that the risks to companies had been rising over the past 30 years in parallel with the increased benefits they offered to members, such as guaranteed inflation-linked pensions. ""At some point, there was a fundamental shift in the need for pension funds to move from seeking investment outperformance to reducing risk, that was not generally recognised,"" he says. Even critics concede that the Boots switch has benefited its 77,000 pensioners and the company. Its timing was stunning. The fund, overseen by chairman of trustees John Watson, sold its GBP1.7bn equity portfolio at the peak of the market, when the FTSE 100 was at an average level of 6,000. Since then, it has fallen about 40 per cent and bond prices continue to rally. While most pension funds are in deficit, the GBP2.4bn Boots fund showed a surplus of GBP170m at March 2002. And the switch reduced management charges on the fund from GBP10m a year to just GBP250,000. The company also believes that its long-term contribution rate would have increased from GBP50m to GBP100m a year if it had not made the move. Overall, Mr Ralfe believes it has left Boots some GBP700m better off. He admits, though, that the timing of the move was partly ""good luck"". ""Members' pensions are largely secure whatever happens to Boots, financial markets and inflation. Counter-intuitively, shareholders' and members' interests turned out to be one and the same,"" says John Shuttleworth, partner at PwC and an ideological ally of Mr Ralfe. ""This is a paradox that those involved in pension fund investment are still chewing on. John Ralfe executed a full-frontal, bravura assault on the many vested interests that surround the pension fund honeypot. And it was wonderful to watch."" Mr Ralfe, who joined Boots in 1991, says discussions over the switch started as early as 1997. ""What we did may appear very purist but along the way there were a lot of two steps forward, two steps back,"" he says. ""It was not absolutely crystal clear because the world is not so crystal clear, both in terms of the technicalities and taking people with you. And we all operate in the real world; ideology only gets you so far."" Mr Ralfe led the campaign of persuasion to switch to bonds but he credits the ""rigorous framework for decision-making"" set up by David Thompson, Boots' former finance director, for allowing it to go ahead. ""It was a framework that was not based on seniority or who could shout loudest or what people had done previously. It was very much a framework that encouraged you to be different and encouraged you to challenge,"" Mr Ralfe says. ""We were still constantly asked: 'If this is the right thing to do, why hasn't anyone else done it?' "" Mr Ralfe declines to comment on his departure from Boots late last year. However, there are understood to have been tensions with Howard Dodd, the new finance director. These were underlined when Boots announced that it was backtracking on its earlier commitment fully to adopt the FRS17 accountancy standard, which was strongly supported by Mr Ralfe. Mr Ralfe says he will now set up a consulting company that will focus on advising companies rather than the traditional industry clients, pension fund trustees. Actuaries say many ailing pension funds are waiting only for markets to recover, to follow some way down the trail blazed by Boots. Others warn that it would be impractical for many to do so, partly because of a shortage of bonds. Some also warn that a large-scale shift into bonds at current levels would be mean ""locking in"" large pension fund deficits that would have to be tackled through increased contributions or cuts in retirement benefits. Mr Ralfe also says he ""certainly would not prescribe a particular approach or solution to all funds"". What may be appropriate for a mature fund with many pensioners may not suit a scheme dominated by younger workers. ""If you could wave a magic wand and go back to the point two years ago where everybody had a surplus and could lock that in through bonds, that would be a fantastic idea, wouldn't it? But the starting-point is now different,"" he says. ""The important thing is for companies to address the issue."""

As Ms Hough takes Mr Hunjan's book she spots that another savings plan offers a better rate. She pulls out some product literature printed in Punjabi. Does Mr Hunjan have a few minutes to talk to a Punjabi-speaker from the accounts team? British businesses are beginning to think seriously about the needs of ethnic minority consumers. Boots offers organic baby foods that have been halal approved by the Muslim Food Board. Staff at BT Group's national call centre in Leicester speak Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi and Hindi. More than 180 organisations, including household names such as LloydsTSB, McDonald's, J. Sainsbury and Cadbury, have joined Race for Opportunity, a network set up under Business in the Community to promote best practice on issues concerning race and diversity. Month by month, the list of companies engaged in ethnic marketing is lengthening. But progress is patchy, even in the sectors in which companies have done most to demonstrate an understanding of minority needs. A case in point is that none of the leading British banks yet offers a mortgage conforming to Islamic sharia law, which forbids the payment of interest. And while the representation of black and Asian consumers in television advertising is improving, few companies know how to target their customers through specialist ethnic media. On first reading, the slowness of advertisers to embrace ethnic marketing is baffling. According to the 2001 census, ethnic minorities make up 9 per cent of England's population. Consumers with an ethnic minority background are typically younger and more likely to own a business than other people; they tend to live in large urban centres, particularly London, creating opportunities for cost-effective local marketing. Furthermore, many ethnic groups retain a close-knit character that makes word of mouth a powerful force to be reckoned with. ""Recommendation is hugely important,"" says Ms Hough. ""A lot of the mortgages that we sell to Sikh customers come about through parents telling their children about us."" Even so, undertaking ethnic marketing is far from plain-sailing, according to Stuart Leach, head of strategic planning at the advertising agency Interfocus. Crucially, Britain's ethnic minorities are extremely fragmented. The Indian community, for instance, includes Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians and a variety of languages. Understanding how cultural attitudes are changing is also vitally important, and bears critically on decisions such as whether to use mainstream or ethnic media and whether to advertise in an ethnic minority language or in English. ""Older people often need communications in their native language but their children may relate better to English,"" says Caroline Waters, director of people networks for BT. ""Many younger people speak in [their native] language with their parents, watch imported films and tune into Asian radio stations, such as Sabras and Sunrise; but they don't necessarily read or write their mother tongue."" Clearly, to understand their target audiences, would-be ethnic marketers need to commission professional research. But even this can prove challenging. ""All the research firms purport to be able to do ethnic work. But a lot simply lack the skills and depth of knowledge that are needed to do a good job,"" says Matthew Bell, director of communications at VSO, the development charity, which has used ethnic research to help recruit black and Asian volunteers. At the heart of the problem is a shortage of suitably qualified professionals. Few agencies employ people with the full complement of skills required for work with people from ethnic minorities. So, many surveys are conducted by freelancers operating off their own bat or under contract to the large research firms. When projects are managed professionally the system is effective; but often there is insufficient control. The upshot is that companies remain wary of commissioning studies that may fail to give them what they need, either because the researchers are poorly skilled or know little about the market they are investigating. One effort to solve the problem has been the Ethnic Researchers Network, launched by a group of market researchers and chaired by Anjul Sharma, associate director at the research agency TRBI. Conceived as a forum for developing British expertise, the network will also offer guidance on how to go about selecting research agencies for ethnic projects. ""As a minimum, clients need to ask who will be moderating, who will design the questionnaire and who will do the analysis, and then satisfy themselves that on top of being technically competent the project team genuinely understands the target market,"" says Ms Sharma. Whatever lingering reservations they may have, companies could find that they are forced to run ethnically focused campaigns in the future simply to avoid losing out to niche marketers. This happened to BT a few years ago, when the cable companies began to target Asian households with a combination of cable TV and telephony. ""We discovered that we weren't getting our messages across, because the people that we needed to reach weren't being caught by mass media communications,"" says Hardeep Walia, local and niche marketing manager for BT. ""Running focused advertising in a mix of Asian press, radio and ethnic television channels, such as Zee TV and Star, allowed us to overturn the perception that we were expensive."" Two years on, BT is so convinced of the benefits of this approach that it is has commissioned research to find out how Afro-Caribbean consumers perceive its services. Ethnic marketing has been slow to get off the ground in Britain. But the old assumption that it is a high-risk, low-return proposition has begun to break down. And there may be more at stake than the opportunity to tap into some under-exploited market segments, according to Mr Leach. From ethnic cuisine, Bollywood films and fashions, and the emergence of a black-influenced urban youth culture, ethnic minorities are leading the mainstream in new directions. If researching ethnic markets enables brand owners to spot trends such as these as they arise, most would regard the investment as money well spent."

After a two-year search it has recruited Sir Michael Jenkins, vice-chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, one of BAE's two lead financial advisers. Jenkins, 30 years a British diplomat and 10 years an investment banker, was at pains yesterday to point out that he had never worked on the BAE account. Still, his capture could prove invaluable if Boeing does team up with Europe's biggest defence contractor. Jenkins, 67, says he knows ""which buttons to press to get things done"" in Whitehall, and is familiar with the City and Brussels, where he spent 10 years. The MCC trustee claims he sorted out a management ""shambles"" at the home of cricket when chairman. Just the man, then, for BAE. No satisfaction Credit Suisse First Boston's annual investment conference in Hong Kong has not been its usual success. About a quarter of the expected 1,300 executives and fund managers wimped out rather than risk exposure to the territory's deadly pneumonia epidemic. CSFB executives also had a nail-biting few hours yesterday before the Hong Kong authorities confirmed that the annual Rugby Sevens tournament (sponsored by the investment bank) could go ahead. After all, the Rolling Stones have cancelled two concerts in Hong Kong this weekend. The band's decision makes sense. When it comes to atypical pneumonia, it's the very old who are most at risk. Booted out Two missing red faces on Thursday as Boots unveiled yet another strategic about-turn. Namely Steve Russell and Sir Nigel Rudd, chief executive and deputy chairman respectively. With Russell responsible for much of the current strategy and Rudd set to chart the future as chairman-elect, it would have been nice to hear from them. Instead, up popped outgoing chairman John McGrath and new-boy finance director Howard Dodd to explain the changes. But don't worry about the wellbeing of Russell and Rudd. They were together yesterday - at a board meeting of Barclays where they are both non-executives. Careful George A display of humanity on Thursday from Sir Edward George, outgoing governor of the Bank of England. He told a mortgage conference that he was keen for Sharia-compliant Islamic mortgages to become widely available in the UK. His interest stems from a meeting 12 years ago with a Muslim couple who had to go against their religious principles to fund a house purchase. A big obstacle to developing Islamic mortgages are the laws on stamp duty. As ever, George chose his words carefully. ""I am hopeful that a way forward can be found at some point, though I dare not speculate on whether it will be covered by the chancellor's Budget next month,"" he said. ""That would be almost as bad as the chancellor speculating about the future course of interest rates."" Brewing up SABMiller, the world's number two brewer, has been fired by its PR agency. At least that's the line from said spinners, Cubitt Consulting. Cubitt said on Thursday it had dropped the account because of ""policy disagreements"" - an unusual, and some would say foolish, move by a PR outfit in straitened times. SABMiller wasn't talking but Observer is assured that the split has nothing to do with the arrival of Sue Clark, formerly of Railtrack, as SABMiller's corporate affairs director. Cubitt's rivals will hardly care as they line up to replace it. Hot topic The current US anathema to all things francais is bad news for America's market-leading mustard, French's. A restaurant in Indiana has dumped the iconic squeezy bottles in favour of a Heinz version - while a weatherman on gung-ho Fox News jibed that French's was not American and that Heinz was a tasty alternative. Worried British brand owner Reckitt Benckiser yesterday pointed out that it was named after New Yorker Robert French and is even the official yellow spread at Yankee stadium. Observer is confused: Heinz sounds distinctly Old Europe too.

Recalling Steel's most famous quote from the heady days of the SDP-Liberal alliance, David McLetchie, the Scottish Tory leader, suggested he should ""go back to your constituency and prepare for retirement"". Then, perhaps remembering the Tories' position in the opinion polls, he added: ""Although that's a problem all of us may have to face."" observer@ft.com."

The Boots chairman had to spend most of Thursday explaining to the City the latest strategic about-turn at the high street chemist chain. This time, the announcement was of the decision to shut the Wellbeing experiment - which included massages along with other health and beauty treatments. Mr McGrath was not helped on Thursday by the complex nature of the Boots' announcement - a damaging cocktail of disappointing sales news and strategic about-turns, with no news on the long-awaited management shake-out. On top of that, analysts were left confused by a series of charges for strategic decisions and news about falling gross margins which were blamed on something that happened 12 months ago. Thursday's decisions come ahead of Mr McGrath's retirement this summer and the imminent replacement of Steve Russell as chief executive. They have left many observers saying that the group was squarely back to where it was three years ago, before the duo took over. Mr Russell introduced the Wellbeing centres, which were trumpeted as the secret to bring sales growth back to Boots. He also brought in the upmarket Pure Beauty chain, the Wellbeing television joint venture and the out-of-town partnership with J Sainsbury. All are now no more. Those close to Mr Russell point out that he does leave a more valuable legacy to his successor. They say he has tied the group's manufacturing arm more closely in with the core retail business - ensuring that serving Boots, rather than its supermarket rivals, is its number one priority. They also point to efforts to bring in a new management team, slim down the leviathan head office and improve the in-store environment for shoppers. But many observers disagree. ""There have been lots of changes, but Boots is still floundering, unable to find a real role for itself,"" said one rival retailer. ""The problem is that the supermarkets are out to get them - and they are not going to go away."" Even his closest supporters admit that Mr Russell oversold many of his ideas for growth - and that they were badly executed and too expensive. Some of the work to bring about a new era was also damaged by yesterday's announcement. Howard Dodd, the new finance director, promised a fresh era of transparency when he took over. Yesterday's muddle over exceptional charges left analysts more confused than ever before. ""I had three conversations with them and I still don't really understand it all properly,"" said one. So there remains plenty for the new chief executive to do - whenever he or she eventually turns up. Mr McGrath might claim that all is going well on the sales front at the core Boots chain. But most analysts disagree. ""The new chief executive has to get the balance right between sales and margins,"" said one. ""They need a real retailer to get in there and take the business by the scruff of the neck."" Strategically, there remains a big question mark over Boots Healthcare International, the manufacturing arm that makes brands such as Nurofen pain-killers and Clearasil skin treatment. The current management says it makes no sense to sell it off. Many observers see it differently. ""They have got to get rid of BHI and then do something with the balance sheet, which is far too under-geared,"" said one. On a more mundane level, the new chief executive will have a lot of work to do rebuilding confidence among the staff in a business where morale is at rock bottom. Mr McGrath had better make sure that he and Sir Nigel Rudd - currently deputy chairman, but set to step up to the chairmanship when Mr McGrath retires in the summer - get the right person, and soon."

You may laugh (I did: ""Nothing like a bit of ironic, anti-style"", I chuckled as I hung ""The Balinese Girl"" on the wall of the downstairs lavatory), but my punt on the low-brow art market has proved a sound investment. ""Original"" framed prints of Tretchikoff's mid-century masterpieces are now selling for more than GBP40. They are not, however, hard to find. The artist's creative zenith, ""The Chinese Girl"" (painted in 1952), was the most reproduced work of the 20th century and once graced the walls of millions of homes. ""My Balinese Girl"" lacks the badge of distinction among ""Tretch"" collectables - a label on the back saying ""framed by Boots"" (or Woolworths) - but ownership has netted an unexpected bonus. Recognised by friends as a Tretch-renaissance, post-modernist, I have since been presented with two gift packs of Tretchikoff coasters, and one of matching table mats. Born in Siberia in 1913, Tretchikoff spent his youth in Shanghai and Singapore, where he worked for the British as a propaganda artist. When he settled in Cape Town (where he still lives), he produced numerous portraits of oriental flowers and sultry ladies from south-east Asia. Though reviled by the art establishment, his work had mass-market appeal and chainstore print sales made Tretchikoff one of the richest artists of all time. Sadly, he is now too senile to witness the resurgent interest in his work. After at least a decade in the proverbial dustbin, four of his paintings were recently re-published by Felix Rosenstiel's Widow and Son, the fine art publisher that represents the Tretchikoff estate. Thereafter, a cultish following fuelled a market in mouse mats, beaded curtains, and other products. The re-issued Tretchikoffs have never made it into Rosenstiel's best-sellers list, but, says Nick Edgar, the company's marketing director: ""Tretchikoff nets more enquiries than any other artist."" An unframed re-print of ""The Chinese Girl"" retails at GBP21.60, but collectors prefer the more expensive vintage originals. They are, I am told, getting more difficult to find. The same might soon be true of the merchandise. Kitschen Sync Ltd, which was licensed to produce the majority of Tretch giftware, ceased trading last month and it is unlikely that anyone else will fill the niche. According to Nick Edgar, the Tretchikoff family (mindful perhaps of the artist's advanced years) have decided to ""show respect"" with regards to the future licensing of products. Prints? Yes. But Green Lady duvet covers? No chance. So, thanks, my friends, for the table mats; they could be worth hanging on to."

There are also good reasons for talented executives to shun the sometimes painful limelight of listed companies in favour of better paid roles in, say, private companies or venture capital funds. Despite Mr Baker's youth and relative inexperience, Boots does need a breath of fresh air rather than a safe pair of hands. The new chief executive has every incentive, and the energy, to try to make his name.

His sense of timing rivalled that shown by Dick Grasso when he nominated Sandy Weill to the New York Stock Exchange's board last month. The New York inquisition did not lead to any charges in court. Mr Purcell clearly feels that Morgan Stanley has nothing to regret. It is a shame, perhaps, that the firm did not take on Eliot Spitzer in court. Given the power of leaks and innuendo, and the treatment meted out to others, it probably served the interests of Morgan Stanley shareholders to settle. Mr Purcell has apologised for his comments and pledged that Morgan Stanley will ""go forward in the spirit of our agreement to make research and markets better for all investors"".

OK, there were no crashing chords from Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto - as in the romantic weepie - when J Sainsbury and Boots announced the end of their ""store within a store trial"" on Monday. But as in the 1946 classic - whose heroine toys with adultery between shopping trips to Boots - this is a story of two decent types who come together for the briefest of relationships and quickly realise that their existing obligations rule out a long-term affair. The trial, which has been going on in nine stores, began at a time when both parties were emotionally vulnerable: Boots had been suffering (and still is) as the health and beauty market became a battle ground for the supermarkets. Sainsbury was coming from behind, trying to catch up Tesco and Asda, with their much greater non-food focus. There were some fanciful suggestions that the trial could lead to a full merger, but that was never realistic. Sainsbury has enough on its plate turning itself around (and now bidding for Safeway) without getting hitched to Boots, which has not been finding it easy to get growth outside its core. And the idea that the trial would lead on to a fuller roll-out was also a long shot: these businesses are already in competition in health and beauty and the rivalry can only grow if the government accepts the Office of Fair Trading's call for supermarkets to be allowed into the pharmacy business. So it is hardly surprising that both sides acknowledged yesterday that they could not agree commercial terms for a roll-out. As in all break-ups, each side claims to be the less damaged party. Sainsbury says it's just fine, thank you very much. It has been running a parallel trial of its own healthy and beauty offering that has been more successful than the one with Boots, and it will now roll that out across 50-100 stores. Boots is also just dandy: it will be incorporating lessons from the trial into an accelerated roll-out of edge-of-town stores. Given all the other dramas surrounding these two companies - such as the battle for Safeway, and impending top management changes at Boots - the unsurprising end of this particular affair should have little impact on market perceptions. Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey, the new chief executive of newspaper group Trinity Mirror, started work on Monday and the shares jumped 6 per cent. Alas, this was not so much a reflection of faith in her abilities as vague hope that the business might be sold out from under her at a substantial premium. It's a heartless world, but possibly over-excited too. For the rise was triggered by a piece of news that, in the fast-moving world of national newspapers, is about as ancient as a reading from Julius Caesar's De Bello Gallico: two tribes, Apax Partners and Candover, from the land of venture capital formed a military alliance last September and approached the commander of Trinity Mirror's legions, bearing with them an informal idea of a takeover. They indicated a possible price of 450p a share - roughly a 10 per cent premium to the company's then price - as part of their efforts to carry out due diligence. But the board concluded the price undervalued the company and discussions ended in November, the month before Ms Bailey was hired. The story certainly confirms that venture capitalists have been sniffing around Trinity Mirror, but that in itself is not entirely surprising. Both Candover and Apex have a track record of successful buy-outs of regional newspapers, which make up the most attractive part of the group's business. And Trinity is hardly expensive on a prospective 2003 p/e of 10.5, with a yield of over 5 per cent. However, any putative bidder knows that Trinity Mirror's national newspapers are a far less alluring proposition, given circulation trends at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People, heavy investment that has yet to produce substantive results, and the threat of even stronger competition from the Sun, now Rebekah Wade has taken over as editor. It is a bold venture capitalist that wants to take on Rupert Murdoch, while the impact of slower consumer spending on the regional titles could give further pause for thought. Nor do Sir Victor Blank, Trinity Mirror's chairman, and the rest of the board seem in any mood to contemplate a break-up, even though this could crystallise the value of the regional titles. They would hardly have hired Ms Bailey, who has no experience of regional newspapers, if this was their plan. And she will doubtless want to develop a strategy of her own.

The company said it saw scope for the health and beauty formats to be expanded to 150 stores within a few years. Jan Shaw, director of corporate relations, said: ""We have trialled our own health and beauty offer and understand it better now. We think we can gain more this way than by selling someone else's range."" Under the original trial, Boots supplied the products, including exclusive lines, to a specific area within Sainsbury's stores at nine out-of-town supermarkets. Although both sides agreed that the initial targets had been met, they could not agree on terms to take it forward. Observers suggested that the two had disagreed over sharing revenues and Sainsbury felt it could do better on its own. One called the outcome predictable, saying that Boots had perhaps given away too much during the trial and Sainsbury had realised it could go it alone. ""At least if Sainsbury's fails it means we will know whether the Boots management team has any value-added,"" said one. Another said it was a setback for Boots, which last month reported its best third-quarter sales growth for more than a decade. ""The trial was an interesting way for Boots to increase its customers. It was a promising growth driver that they have now lost,"" he said. In place of the store-within-a-store, Boots said yesterday it would accelerate its edge-of-town programme, which has 77 stores. Steve Russell, chief executive, said he expected this number to double in the next two to three years. He denied that a series of high profile departures and top management changes at Boots, including his own resignation and a new finance director, had had any influence on the decision to end the trial. ""We could have done both projects, but only if the financial conditions for both were right,"" he insisted. Yesterday Boots confirmed the departure of another senior member of management. Michael Bunting, head of treasury, which dealt with Boots' surplus cash, will leave in April. Boots said the move was part of its strategy of slimming down top management. Other senior staff who have left recently include Barry Clare, marketing director, and Ken Piggott, who was managing director of Boots' core business. Boots shares rose 13lp - or 2.5 per cent - to 535lp; Sainsbury shares were up 11p - nearly 5 per cent - to 2461/4p."

So how to explain recent cuts at the Alliance Francaise in London, a French version of the British Council which has done more to promote French among the rosbifs than any other body? The AF last year generated more than GBP1m of fees teaching French to 3,000 businessmen and others in the London area. The surplus went to help 12 regional centres hold Bastille Day parties and the like. Now Paris has decided it will no longer bankroll a senior manager to run the London teaching operation - just weeks before the academic year begins. It will have to rub along on junior staff. It's all come as a bombshell for the British directors of charity AFUK, such as economist Uwe Kitzinger and Sir John Weston, former UN ambassador. ""The board is furious at being confronted by a fait accompli with no consultation. The French embassy appears unable to influence Paris. Resignations are looming,"" says Observer's man with the beret. That might overshadow next years's centenary of the entente cordiale. Rudd's boot Boardroom junkie Sir Nigel Rudd doesn't give a fig for Higgs. In September he'll step up to be Boots non-exec chairman - and shareholders attending Thursday's Boots annual meeting in London expressed concern that he's overstretching himself. After all, he's already chairman of Pilkington, Pendragon, Kidde and corporate finance boutique Bridgewell Securities. And he's on the board of Barclays. Don't fear. He plans to get out and about. ""Meetings aren't the best way of running a company,"" he smoothed on Thursday. And how's he going to watch over so many chief executives? ""I have a good track record of controlling them,"" he teased. New Boots boss Richard Baker has been warned. Hutton's hols Holiday worries in the Westminster village. Will Lord Hutton's inquiry into the death of David Kelly disrupt those planned trips to Chianti-shire? The prime minister has already volunteered to forsake his Barbados beach if summoned by his lordship - and others must surely follow suit. What about Hutton himself? He stands little chance of getting a tan while cooped up in courtroom 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice. Lord Falconer certainly didn't consider whether Hutton had a summer break planned. ""I haven't asked him about his holiday,"" the constitutional affairs secretary confessed on Thursday. One person definitely affected is Greg Dyke, BBC director-general. He has delayed his departure for deepest, darkest Peru to oversee what one insider termed ""a bloody fierce battle"" with the government. His family are thought to have flown off to South America without him, although he could be heading off to the Inca Trail at the weekend. Bottom line Dressing down might be old hat but sartorial standards have been slipping at Deutsche Bank. Sweltering staff have been sent a memo regarding the dress ""standards"" expected. ""Our offices are a continual showcase for clients and official organisations,"" writes human resources boss Elizabeth Warren. ""Certain rules need to be followed"". So denim jeans, oversized clothing, sports attire, shorts, beach sandals and trainers are now on the banned list. What's more, ""cropped or strapless tops, very short skirts and tank tops are not suitable for office wear"". What about a memo for the girls? Cautious driving Difficult driving conditions for DaimlerChrysler, what with a big second quarter loss on Thursday. Time for those racing to succeed Jurgen Schrempp, 58, as chief executive, to show off a little? Eckhard Cordes, 52, head of trucks, could have cut up rival Dieter Zetsche, 50, head of lossmaking Chrysler in the US. After all, trucks reported surprisingly good profits. But both were coy. ""There have been improvements all over the place,"" Cordes purred. ""We don't comment on specific units."" Perhaps the pair have taken note of hints Schrempp has dropped recently that he will seek to extend his contract, which expires in 2005. Schrempp had thought he could show just how inspirational the merger had been by then. Now, apparently, he is not so sure.

The ""cult of the equity"" has been the bedrock of UK pension schemes since George Ross Goobey famously moved Imperial Tobacco's pension fund into equities in the early 1950s. Things are now less straightforward: pension schemes are coping with a higher proportion of pensioners, a three-year bear market, lower real interest rates, more transparent actuarial valuations and accounting, and scrutiny from credit rating agencies. They have also had to address the argument - expounded by financial economists since the late 1970s - that pension assets and liabilities should be matched. Accordingly, UK and US pension funds should hold bonds rather than equities and the company backing the fund - the ""sponsor"" - should gear up its balance sheet through a share buyback. Two years ago yesterday, Boots' GBP2.3bn pension fund responded to the challenges facing UK pension funds, announcing that it had sold all its equities and moved every last penny to long-dated AAA bonds. It was a radical step that is now being studied by tomorrow's professional investors. Today, Harvard Business School is to begin using the Boots' action as a case study on one of its MBA courses. Boots reminded everyone of the self-evident truth forgotten in recent years: ""the job of the pension fund is to pay pensions"". Even the most sceptical have to agree that asset allocation should be driven by the nature of the specific pension liabilities: the fund's commitment to pay pensions. Corporate pension fund management is as much about managing liabilities as managing assets. Conventional wisdom treats company pension funds as if they have a life of their own. In truth, they are not self-contained entities, like the funds of private individuals. They are simply part of the sponsoring company, which in turn has private shareholders. Conventional wisdom ignores the impact on the company sponsor of its pension fund holding equities. The economics of holding equities in its pension fund is the same as if it carried debt on its balance sheet - with all the gearing and increased financial risk this implies. For the company, holding equities in its pension fund is not a sensible way to achieve gearing: it is not tax-efficient or transparent, it incurs high fees and management costs, and it increases risk for pension scheme members. Conventional wisdom also ignores the impact on the ultimate owner of the pension fund's sponsoring company - the private shareholder. By holding equities in its pension fund, a company is doing nothing its private shareholders cannot do directly, more tax efficiently and more transparently themselves. Perhaps most of all, conventional wisdom ignores the fundamentally changed nature of defined benefit pensions. Forty years ago, a UK defined benefit pension was, like today, based on an employee's final salary and the number of years contributing to the scheme. It had a guaranteed element but this was only part of what people got in practice. Trustees had discretion to increase benefits if there were fund assets to pay for the increase. In effect, it was like a ""with-profits"" investment policy, so it made sense to hold some bonds - to match the guaranteed element - and some equities - since members shared the risk and reward.. It also made sense for the company because the chances of it needing to make up any shortfall against the guaranteed element was low and, at the same time, it benefited from equity outperformance through reduced contributions. But, in the intervening years, many discretionary benefits have become guaranteed. Trustees and sponsoring companies have baked into individual trust deeds such things as limited inflation indexation, more generous life cover and early retirement terms. On top of these changes - agreed by trustees and the company bilaterally - successive governments have raised the stakes, requiring companies, by law, to guarantee more benefits. As a consequence, the defined benefit pension has changed from a with-profits investment policy to an annuity. So the question is, should trustees hold equities to back an annuity? Trustees should be protecting the guaranteed pension, which can only be done with bonds. They should not be seeking outperformance through equities, which increases the risk of the guaranteed element not being paid. Company sponsors did not realise that increased guarantees increased their risk of being called upon to fund a pension shortfall. In the 1950s, George Ross Goobey was right to hold equities not bonds. Today, however, his heirs are wrong to insist that nothing has changed. The world has moved on - and so should corporate pension funds. John Ralfe is an independent pension consultant. He was head of corporate finance at Boots from 1991 to 2002.

Before he joined Boots from Asda, the supermarket chain owned by Wal-Mart of the US, Mr Baker said he felt the group needed a greater focus on the stores. But, according to insiders at the group, he was so shocked by what he found when he started less than two months ago that he decided he needed to give store managers a greater say. This breaks the traditional Boots model of command and control from the Nottingham headquarters. ""Richard has gone berserk about the state of the stores,"" said one senior Boots insider. ""He has talked to the store managers and what has become apparent is the disconnect between the head office and the stores."" The move - which allows store managers greater freedom in areas such as staff recruitment and deployment and point of sale promotions - has increased speculation that Mr Baker is considering job cuts at Boots headquarters, which employs more than 7,000 people. The headcount has already been reduced sharply, but many people feel there is space for further cuts. It also increases the chances that he will shake up the senior management ranks. In particular, it is thought he will want to bring in former colleagues from Asda and other supermarket businesses. ""Richard says he has searched high and low in Boots head office and not found a retailer yet,"" said the insider. ""This is a huge bureaucracy that has been built on over the years where everything is an intellectual exercise. But there is a hugely different attitude in the stores."" Mr Baker is likely to outline details of his move when he unveils Boots interim results next week. But he is expected to say that it is too early to give an overview of more far reaching changes - with news on wider strategic changes unlikely before next year. ""Richard will just outline some early observations,"" said one person close to the plans. There will, however, be intense interest in even his initial thoughts. Mr Baker's appointment to Boots was welcomed by those who felt the retail group badly needed shaking up by an outsider - particularly someone from a supermarket background. Boots has been losing ground to the supermarkets which have been aggressively seeking growth in the health and beauty market."

John McGrath, chairman, will act as chief executive until Richard Baker, Asda's former chief operating officer, is released from ""gardening leave"" in September. Mr McGrath will then leave to be replaced by Sir Nigel Rudd, deputy chairman of the group. The latest moves mean that all the top jobs at Boots will have changed in less than a year. Howard Dodd, finance director since March last year, is also expected to take centre-stage. Mr Dodd has changed many of the group's policies since he was brought on, including backtracking on an earlier commitment to adopt the FRS 17 accounting standard for pension funds. He is also known for opposing a policy common among many retailers of inflating the bottom line by counting many costs as exceptionals. When Boots reported disappointing fourth-quarter sales figures in March - the equivalent to a profits warning - it promised to ditch its lossmaking Wellbeing unit and outlets in the Netherlands and Italy, at an expected cost of GBP55m ($90.6m). Boots is now expected to report profits in the GBP540m-GBP550m range, against the previously hoped for GBP575m-GBP580m. A dividend of 28.5p is expected to be paid from earnings per share of 45.7p. The results will contrast with last year's 10 per cent increase in underlying profit to GBP639m, on sales of GBP5.33bn. Boots Retail, which accounts for 80 per cent of sales, had increased profits by 1 per cent. Investors will want to see whether Boots, whose operating costs have traditionally been high, has started to implement the cost-cutting programme it announced in November."

While the ECB is expected to cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, from the current 2.5 per cent, the Bank of England is forecast to hold firm when it meets the same day. Ian Stewart, chief European economist at Merrill Lynch, said slowing economic growth, rising unemployment, weakening consumer spending and the appreciation of the euro against the dollar point to the right conditions for a rate cut. Mr Stewart said Merrill Lynch uses a rule of thumb analysis to correlate currency moves with interest rates, which is a six per cent change in a currency relates to a one per cent move in interest rates. ""The euro has risen 2.6 per cent on a trade weighted basis since the last (ECB) meeting, which almost equates to a 50 basis point cut,"" he said. Fixed rate investors are already factoring in a 50 basis point cut. Mr Stewart said no change or a 25 point cut, would jolt bond and currency markets. Eurozone data should reinforce the need to cut with the manufacturing and service sector business conditions still contracting, inflation returning to the ECB ceiling of 2 per cent, plus further falls in producer prices and retail sales. The anticipated cut will be the second ECB cut this year with economists predicting more by the end of December. The ECB made a quarter point cut in March. Another move could trigger further central bank cuts in Europe with Denmark, Sweden and Norway all forecast to reduce rates in June. In contrast the sterling has fallen 0.9 per cent against trade weighted currencies in the past month. Economic data for Britain this week is expected to reveal firm consumer credit growth, plus improving manufacturing and service sector business conditions. Sterling's fall and improving economic conditions should ease pressure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to cut rates. Last month the MPC voted 5-4 to keep rates steady, although long-time dove Christopher Allsopp left the MPC last week. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is also tipped to cut rates on Thursday from the current rate of 5.5 per cent, the highest in the western world. Its neighbour the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Wednesday, but it is expected to keep rates on hold for the 12th consecutive month, with some economists tipping no change for at least another year. The Bank of Canada meeting tomorrow is expected to see rates kept on hold, although economists are forecasting a hike later in the year to add to April's 25 basis point rise. In the US this week, moderate improvements are expected in both the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices, productivity growth is forecast to outpace labour costs, consumer credit is tipped to jump from the previous reading. Although factor orders are seen slipping and non-farm payrolls are likely to decline for the seventh consecutive month. The adage of sell in May and go away is proving to be untrue for stock markets so far this year. The Tokyo stock market was up 10 per cent last month, albeit from near 20 year lows. The Nasdaq has risen about eight percent, London's FTSE-100 is up 5 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4 per cent, while the French and German markets lag with gains of about 1 per cent. A relatively quiet corporate results week is expected with BAA, Ryanair, Boots, Cable &Wireless, Munich Re and Richemont reporting."

The move, coming six weeks after he joined Boots from supermarket chain Asda, underlined Mr Baker's determination to rejuvenate the group's flagging stores, and signalled the likelihood of radical changes to the property portfolio. The changes include the departure of two leading directors - Andy Smith, the board director with responsibility for human resources, and Ann Francke, the marketing director who joined the group in February. Both left yesterday, Mr Smith with an expected GBP350,000 pay-off while the group did not disclose Ms Francke's compensation as she was not a board director. Mr Baker said it had been important to move quickly and create a leaner management structure. ""This is a clear signal to the organisation about the pace and decisiveness and clarity needed,"" he said. ""When you are new you cannot afford to take ages over a decision like this."" Boots insiders highlighted two changes: the news that Mr Baker intends to appoint a new trading director, probably from outside the group, and the fact that he has handed responsibility for the property portfolio to Howard Dodd, the group's ambitious finance director. Earlier this week it was revealed that Mr Baker's first strategic move at Boots had been to devolve power to store managers - breaking the group's traditional model of command and control from the Nottingham headquarters. Yesterday, he said the management changes were designed to support that move, especially the creation of a retail director - with Mr Baker convinced that Boots does not have enough top retail talent at head office. While some at Boots felt Mr Baker was bound to recruit from Asda or Tesco - with supermarkets presenting the biggest competition challenge - he refused to say where he would be looking. ""But I know we could attract somebody into a big role like this who is a very strong retail player,"" he added. The director will work alongside David Kneale, chief operating officer, who will take the new role of chief commercial officer with responsibility for trading, marketing and formats. Paul Bateman, operations director in charge of factories and logistics, adds human resources to his job. Mr Dodd will take responsibility for Boots' 1,420 stores and its massive head office infrastructure, a substantial increase in power for a man whose reforms have annoyed some long-time staff. xref Observer, Page 22."

Since then, my mailbox has been filled by people who say they are sticking to DIY because they have been let down by cowboy tradesmen. Not dodgy decorators or crooked carpenters, but economic forecasters. Most economists do not do forecasting and, like honest craftsmen, they resent those who earn more money for shoddier work. Several decades ago, in the first flush of naive enthusiasm for the potential of computers, many people believed that large models would describe the evolution of the economy ever more perfectly. But these hopes were unfounded. It is not that economists are insufficiently clever, or their tools insufficiently powerful. Predicting whether the dollar will rise or fall in the second quarter of next year, or the level of the Standard &Poor's index at the end of 2004, is in principle impossible. The reasons fall into two main groups. Many of the processes we find in commercial and economic life are dynamic and non-linear. What this means in everyday life is that small differences in where you start can make a large difference to where you end up. Almost everyone is now familiar with the metaphor of the butterfly whose flapping wings provoke a tornado weeks later, thousands of miles away. If small events can have large effects on complex systems, even knowing 99 per cent of what you need to know leaves you vulnerable to large errors. And 100 per cent knowledge is impossible. That is why we can never aspire to accurate forecasting of economic events, just as we can never know whether it will rain on June 4 next year or the date of the next Tokyo earthquake. But economics is even harder than meteorology or seismology. Most economic systems are reflexive - what happens is influenced by how we perceive what will happen. Good mechanisms for forecasting stock prices will not be found because their very discovery would affect stock prices. If there had been reliable predictions that the value of the euro would move from $1.17 to 81 cents and back again, these movements would not have occurred. But we can identify earthquake zones even if we cannot predict earthquakes and we can look forward to summer even if we cannot forecast the weather on June 4 next. Seismologists tell us where not to build our houses, and meteorologists help us know where to sell sun cream and when to take an umbrella. Useful economic knowledge is of a similar kind. When the value of the euro fell below a dollar, it was virtually certain to appreciate, because it is rare for the currencies of rich countries to deviate so far from purchasing power parity for long. But no one could have successfully predicted just when the euro would appreciate, or that it would first fall to almost 80 cents, although the pattern of momentum in the short run and mean reversion in the long run is a common feature of speculative markets. And, in answer to the questions some readers may be asking: you need to take an economics course to learn about purchasing power parity and mean reversion, and a physics course to learn about momentum, and yes, I did fill my boots with euros at an average price of 87 cents. But, despite the inevitable failures of economic forecasting, people continue to want the knowledge it would provide. As even DIY economics will tell you, where there is demand there will be supply. Cowboy tradesmen remain in business because there are always gullible customers, and the same is true of economic forecasters. But when someone tells you that the dollar will appreciate in the second quarter of next year, or what the level of the S &P will be at the end of 2004, they do not know what they are talking about. If they did, they would not be making these predictions. But if you stop asking economists to forecast the future, there are other interesting things they can tell you. I predict this column will appear again next Wednesday, and hope you will find something in it to enjoy and profit from. ."

A pair of knock-off Dolce and Gabbana sunglasses obscure her eyes and her face is half hidden behind loose, dark curls, yet there is no masking her sharp chin and shapeless body. ""I know they are watching me. It's normal,"" Diana says as we stroll around the city's Chinatown. ""Some people think I'm sexy. Some people recognise me from the neighbourhood. Other people probably don't know what to think."" If there is a giveaway, it's her gait. Diana has lived as a transvestite for seven years but she still walks like a little girl dressed up in her mother's high-heeled shoes. Yet that could be blamed on nerves. Diana, 29, heads the transvestite review at Estrella Cafe and Saturday night marks her return after a break. ""You should phone right away,"" she advises. ""My public will be expecting me."" A big shortcoming of Havana tourism is that it offers everything that a visitor was expecting. Vintage American cars really do sputter through the pot-holed streets. The buildings truly crumble with heartbreaking majesty. The sun bakes everything from on high and the people below only seem more alluring for the swelter. Few would claim that a sun-drenched, rum-fuelled holiday flit among Cuba's beaches and salsa bars could be anything but restorative. But ever since President Fidel Castro opened his island to spendthrift tourists, he has been peddling that image and selling his island short. Communist idealism becomes the perfect framework for tourist marketing - visit the land where timelessness and nostalgia walk hand in hand. No reader will be surprised to learn that Cuban life is not as contented as that. And genuine Cuban culture keeps a more restless beat. It can't be found on a fortnight all-inclusive; it rarely appears on tourist brochures. Months reporting from the island taught me to seek it in encounters with transvestites, a bit of music or neighbourhood gossip. For example, a perfectly respectable Cuban salsa can be heard at almost any tourist hotel. But for the island's youth, the Buena Vista Social Club is yesterday; today's disenchanted generation finds its voice in rap. Havana's autumn Rap Festival is an annual highlight with better-known artists performing at Casa de Musica and Teatro America. But the weekly highlight for grass-roots rap is the Saturday matinee at Cafe Cantante - a subterranean club below the national theatre in the Vedado district. There, in the shadow of the Plaza of the Revolution - that towering emblem of communist solidarity - hundreds of rap enthusiasts weekly sway, sweat and chant to a defiant beat. ""This is the typical Cuban way,"" Malcolms Duffay, a 27-year-old rapero chants in Spanish. ""We are raised in everything. We are raised in nothing. I am of the ghetto, the hood, the street."" In a society that demands conformity, rap lyrics are the closest thing to open political dissent. Comedy might also qualify. If one of Cuban television's popular sketch programmes is on the air, a crowd is sure to have gathered. Almost every aspect of Cuban culture can come under comedic fire - the meagre food rations, bad transportation, collapsing buildings and even the government's conflicting decrees. Such humour is tolerated because, in the end, the joke is on the Cubans. Cuban comedy is remarkable - whether it's the bone-dry wit of the streets or the affected sketches of the few professional comedians. If you venture to one of Havana's clubs, you're likely to hear both. Jokes may be lost to the Cuban accent and an untrained ear will miss local references, but these acts show how some Cubans cope. The government's attitude to culture may best be described as quietly permissive. The era of official persecution of sexual identity is over and while gays refrain from open shows of affection, transvestites such as Diana can be spotted. One of the first transvestite shows was, in fact, run by the state. By all accounts it was popular but short-lived and private cabarets that had sprung up were also forced to close. Three changes of address in eight years brought the Estrella Cafe to the rooftop of Rogelio Conde, a celebrated hairstylist, in an otherwise quiet neighbourhood on the outskirts of Havana. The cabaret has since gone 18 months unmolested. The cabaret is furnished with plastic tables and wooden chairs. Decoration is limited to a triptych of faded portraits: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley and a half-dressed Latin male. Just before 11 o'clock, show time, about 40 guests have taken their seats when Diana emerges in a figure-hugging, gold sequin dress and opens by lip-synching a slow, Spanish lament. The crowd is impassive but when she returns a few numbers later, this time in thigh-high black leather boots and teddy, belting out a crackling pop anthem, a dozen fans mount the stage to stuff cash in her cleavage. During a musical intermission, Diana takes a seat on the stage next to Samantha - a six-foot tall, platinum-haired compere - and begins cooling her face with a silk, Chinese fan. ""Thank you all for welcoming me back,"" Diana coos, ""I've wanted to be here, but my brother was in hospital and I had to be with him."" At Samantha's prompting, Diana recounts meeting her estranged father for the first time since her transformation. It was at her brother's hospital bedside; Diana's father arrived to find her sleeping in a chair in the room. ""When I opened my eyes my father was right in front of my face, trying to recognise me. Then he shouted at me to get out of his sight."" Diana laughed at this story and the audience laughed, too. Cuban transvestites know something about loneliness but Diana is luckier than many. She lives with her mother, enjoys the acceptance of most of her family and has a loving boyfriend - though he is banned from the cabaret after going into a jealous rage during one show. ""When I first started to live like this, people told me I had a lot of courage,"" Diana says. ""They are right. It takes courage and more. It's not easy, but this is the only life I recognise.""

"Factiva-20230329-1440 (2).rtf","Document FTCOM00020031108dzb70002e","7 November 2003","Echoes from the front line.","2,337 words","I have a photograph of my great grandfather Edwin Grimm in his army uniform, his daughter Alice by his side, looking, well, much as his surname suggests. According to family lore, Edwin had fought in the first world war, been wounded, won some medals and complained about the bread. No one was really sure what regiment he had fought with. We weren't a family who took military participation very seriously. Later, I began to research a book about my grandmother, Edwin's daughter, who had emigrated to Canada with Barnardo's in 1914. Her mother had died in childbirth. To find out more about her, I had to return to him. After being left cold by the regimental diary and finding his service records had been destroyed during bombing in the second world war, a biographer friend suggested visiting the Documents Department at the Imperial War Museum in London. It took just one phone call to fix an appointment. A few weeks later I found myself waiting in the reception of the vast 19th century building, the former Bethlehem Hospital (or Bedlam as it was commonly called) that sits on city's south bank. A security guard led me to the reading room - up several floors in a small, rickety lift, away from all of the military hardware to Bedlam's former chapel in the copper-domed cupola. Here I joined a cosy community of fellow searchers - some rumpled academics, schoolchildren researching projects, American tourists looking up family history before flying home. If the windows were lower, I would have had a panoramic view over south London, but instead, I was left to contemplate the 10 commandments, painted high on the wall. Perhaps inevitably in a museum dedicated to war, I dwelt on the irony of the eighth, thou shall do no murder. If the museum is criticised for glorifying war on its lower levels (and surely the permanent Holocaust Exhibit should silence those critics) then up here in the Reading Room, you get to see things differently. Left for me at a designated seat, was a pile of folders, books and manuscripts. The more delicate items were photocopies but for the most part they were original letters, diaries and battalion orders (each neatly tied with a piece of cloth), from members of the 7th Somerset Light Infantry. Edwin was mentioned several times - punished for overstaying his leave and for being found drunk in the High Street in Staines. The letters, all from the early days of training when the 7ths were waiting to go to France (they did not leave England until July 1915), provided something else entirely - a sense of being there - of the experience of waiting to fight, the boredom and the monotony and one, extraordinary incident that although it didn't explain Edwin, made him more to me than a miserable man. According to the letters, the men woke one morning in January 1915 to four inches of snow on the ground. The falling snow soon turned to rain. They were hoping this meant that the day's parade for the benefit of Lord Kitchener - the poster-boy recruiter of the ""ordinary"" soldier - and the French minister of war, would be put off but, as one put it, no such luck. In a letter to his mother on January 24, one IVB Melthuish described the day: ""We left Barracks at 11am for the review ground. Of course the roads were awful, thick slush and mud and naturally everyone had their boots full of water. Long before we had completed the seven miles to the ground most of us were wet to the skin, in spite of macks and coats. We got to the parade grounds at 1.30pm [he draws a map to explain the geography]. Kitchener did not turn up till 4pm and then he only went by in a closed car and we did not see him. Those two-and-a-half hours standing in water and slush around our ankles, wet through with a biting wind, driving sleet and heavy rain against you all the time was about the nearest to hell I have so far experienced. The only recreation and amusement we had was to count the (faints ???) people who had fainted and had to be carried out. The engineers won with 32, our company had eight only. The scandal was that 12,000 men had been brought out seven miles from home with one small ambulance wagon to hold six... fortunately only two died. Melthuish somehow manages to see the experience in a positive light: ""It shows that the men are splendid. They held the most splendid discipline - laughing and singing though they were too cold to move their hands - I don't think Germany will win."" Reading the letters and memoirs and sifting though the personal memorabilia in the Reading Room, lets the experience of war get under your skin in the way that official biographies and even well-written history books never can. I have been moved to tears in the Reading Room and have felt like jumping for joy. Every student of history should spend time there. There are more than 14,000 ""collections"", some consist of a single letter, others fill up 80 boxes, covering every big conflict since the Great War. When it was created by an Act of Parliament in 1920, the Imperial War Museum was set up not only as a museum but also as a memorial to the Commonwealth dead. But the collecting, and thinking about how the war was to be memorialised, began during the war itself. The War Cabinet decided in 1917 that committees would be set up to ""earmark"" material for a possible museum. Hardware - guns, shells and vehicles - were collected straight off the battlefield. There was a dedicated store on the western front, where unwanted gear was collected and shipped back to England. Here it was housed at Crystal Palace as a kind of trophy collection and members of the public were invited to come and have a look, in effect ""to see what our boys are up against"". George V opened the official postwar exhibit on June 9 1920, and a million people flocked to see the displays in its first month. When the exhibits moved in 1924 to the smaller Imperial Institute in South Kensington, many of the larger ones were sold for scrap and it was not until 1930 that the museum found a more permanent home when the Bethlehem Hospital moved to Kent. The hardware was easy to collect; but the diaries and letters of ordinary men and women caught up in the war proved more difficult. Documents which were ""outside"" the official history of the first world war - those of conscientious objectors such as W. Harrison, who wrote to the recruitment tribunal which sentenced him to two years in Wormwood Scrubs prison: ""I cannot and will not commit murder"" - came long after the first influx of the papers of generals and military men. ""It was not until the 1950s and 60s that the Museum got the material that criticised the war,"" says archivist Steve Walton. He puts this down to a combination of factors: the men of the first world war were near the end of their lives and were ""putting their papers in order"" and it was also the time when memoir writing began to become popular. It took some time for the ""seminal"" experience of the Great War to seep into the consciousness of the men and women involved in it. Now, the museum gets about 500 ""donations"" every year. Some donors arrive unannounced with a suitcase in hand. Many are very trusting - handing over what they've found in their attic or their father's papers and telling the museum to do what they like with the material. The Museum has bought some documents in sales, but it rarely has to do so. As Walton walks me through the storage vault, he randomly selects bound books filled with extraordinary lives: an Austrian countess who served with the British Army as a translator after World War II, whose letters to her mother read like a Barbara Cartland novel; a German POW's scrapbook collected by the British army including the photographs of two Russian nurses; and love letters written by an army medical officer to his wife. For an archivist like Walton, what is evident is how letter-writing, even during wartime, has over time become a dying art. The first world war letters are extraordinary documents. As Walton points out, that war was largely static: soldiers stayed in one place for long periods of time and, perhaps more importantly, they were part of a generation still imbued with the Victorian penchant for writing letters. Men included drawings of their dugouts for their children, wrote complicated sets of instructions for domestic chores to be carried out in their absence by their wives and mothers, as well as trying to make them understand the life they were leading. The second world war is documented more by memoirs, written after the war, which Walton says are often less immediate because they have been informed by subsequent reading and meditation. But as Walton showed me, even these are evocative. Teenager Veronica Goddard's diligently kept scrapbook of the war is evidence, if any were needed, of the tenacity of a typical Londoner under fire. She rounds on the local authorities for taking their time in camouflaging the Earls Court Exhibition - ""about time too - it is is a huge white building that can be seen for miles"". On the first of January, 1940 she writes, shocked: ""New Year's Day and the war is not over yet!"" During the blitz, she records: ""Jerry disturbed me in my bath! No warning at all; just this appalling noise of a bomb whizzing out of the sky right across the house. But did I get out quick?"" Later she notes wearily, ""there is hardly a quiet night any more"". There are also experiences so horrific that the time lapse before those affected put pen to paper makes perfect sense. When the cellist Anita Lasker wrote her memoirs in the 1980s she did so, as she puts it to her children: ""with one thought in my mind, namely that I am dedicating it to you and to your children. We have never talked much about those dark days and how it came about that you do not have any grandparents. I was 20 years old when I finally came to England and a mad scramble began to try to make up for lost time"". Lasker donated her memoir and her letters to the museum. As Jews living in Breslau, the threat of the Nazis is palpable. Her father's letters to various friends and organisations abroad trying to get his daughters to safety become desperate as the weeks draw near to the start of the war. Included as well are Lasker's own exchanges with her sister Marianne, the only one of the family not to witness first-hand the horrors of the concentration camps because she had already emigrated to England. Lasker's parents were shot; she and her sister Renate survived both Auschwitz and Belsen. After the liberation of Belsen in 1945, at the age of 20, she writes to her sister: ""My beloved Marianne, It is hard - very hard - to be equal to coping with one's unhappiness and misery, but it seems to me even harder to be equal to be coping with one's happiness. You asked what we need most. Please send photos. Photos of you, your husband and please - if at all possible - of the parents and of home. We need of nothing else. Clothes? To us it is no question since we are used to having only what we stand up in."" Reading Lasker's memoir, we understand why she writes in another letter: ""If only in my life I shall be able to love as much as I hate now"". That is what moved me to tears. And what was it that made me want to jump for joy in the quiet sepulchre of the Reading Room? Anita writes after the war from Belsen, where she is helping the British Army with translating and is about to appear as a witness in the war crimes tribunal (her sister's pass for the tribunal is included): ""My above everything else beloved Marianne, I write in a hurry because I am horrendously excited. Today I come back to our room after breakfast with Renate and what do I see lying on my bed? Just simply lying on my bed? Have you guessed? I HAVE A CELLO."" A programme of a concert given in Belsen on July 29 is included; Anita Lasker was the cellist. Steve Walton doubts that the same flow of evocative letters and memoirs will arise from such post-second world war conflicts as the Malayan Emergency or the Falklands War. Soldiers are no longer out of contact for such prolonged periods of time. We are no longer writers, preferring faster means of communication. I read the letters exchanged between four friends from the first Iraq war and while they were not as moving as the others I had looked at, there was still something lurking in those letters which provoked a response, a horror of war. In a letter written by a soldier serving with Operation ""Granby"", the British contribution to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the writer, bombastic about his experience, concludes that, ""All in all we didn't do too bad - only two dead and about four or five injured - but upon reading this it wasn't as easy as it sounds and I must admit I wouldn't want to do it again"". To me, there is an echo of his comrades (comrades such as Edwin Grimm and IVB Melthuish????) in the first world war."

The new Boots chief executive was brutally frank about the shortcomings of the previous management at the health and beauty retailer. His long list of criticisms basically boil down to one key point: Boots had become a really bad retailer. That was the simple bit; diagnosis is far easier than cure. Now, Mr Baker has to turn a lumbering leviathan into a modern-day retailer. In his favour, he has 10 years at Asda under his belt - which came after 10 years at Mars. There he lived through the turnround of Archie Norman and Allan Leighton, the group's head-long march into non-food and the takeover by Wal-Mart, the US discount giant. Many who have worked with him say he is ambitious and driven - but one who is great at motivating staff from the shop floor through to the boardroom. All this will be invaluable. In particular, having lived through two cultural revolutions should help as he struggles to change the deeply-entrenched civil service-like nature of Boots. It also means investors might have to piece together various clues to find out what Mr Baker is doing. He was keen to point out on Thursday that in the past couple of years at Asda he has enjoyed the anonymity that being part of a larger group gave. He would pore over the publicly-uttered plans of quoted rivals and be able to move swiftly to beat them. Hence, there are no plans for big strategic announcements at Boots. Mr Baker says they would be of most use to the people at Tesco and Asda. Thursday's pronouncement may have been long on criticism, but Mr Baker was quick to point out that, seven weeks into the job, he did not have all the answers and there were no quick fixes. Indeed, some question whether Boots, with its markets facing threat from the supermarkets, can be fixed at all. Still, insiders say he has already started re-energising the business - particularly store managers who were disenchanted by the previous failure to focus directly on the core business. It is a promising start. LSE What a delicious case of the pot calling the kettle black. For months, the London Stock Exchange has been warning that the proposed merger of the mutually-owned London Clearing House, with for-profit Clearnet of France, risks creating a price-gouging monopoly utility. On Thursday the LSE announced that for about a year the Office of Fair Trading has been investigating increases in the fees it charges companies for listing on the exchange. Can this be the same OFT that recently raised no competition objections to the LCH-Clearnet deal? The LSE's tariff increases, announced in April last year, were whoppers, averaging about 30 per cent but totalling more than 70 per cent for the largest companies. The exchange, of course, pretty well has a monopoly on listings in London and the price rises came as it moved from a mutual to a profit-maker. There was no word on Thursday on how the OFT case is proceeding. But the exchange, which used to run the UK's listings regime, ought to know better than any company that material information must be released to the market speedily, so one has to assume this has been a very small cloud in its sky - at least until now. Even so, analysts would like to have known earlier, and the fact that it is ""negotiating a resolution"" with the competition authorities suggests it may have to give ground. The case underscores the vigilance required of competition authorities across Europe as mutual exchanges have morphed into quasi-monopoly profit-makers. Where possible, their powers should be checked by competition, and the LSE has given a useful lesson in doing this by playing off LCH against Deutshe Borse. Analysts believe the exchanges' listing charge increases raised about GBP10m extra of revenue a year. Foregoing some of that would not be disastrous, but it could be a significant blow when times are already tough. Thursday's interim results, in line with expectations, were essentially flat and the outlook is clouded. There is little sign of a strong recovery in new issues and further revenue declines are likely in information terminals. Morgan Stanley predicts a 10 per cent drop this year and 4 per cent or more next. After Thursday's sharp fall the shares stand on a prospective p/e of 17, a big premium to Euronext and Deutsche Borse, for which the only rational explanation is bid speculation. Philip Green Philip Green on Thursday announced he had taken a GBP203m dividend from his BHS clothing chain last year - and caused some raised eyebrows since BHS borrowed GBP250m from Barclays Capital partly to fund it. But as Mr Green owns BHS, he can jolly well do as he pleases, and analysts would be urging any publicly quoted company with a similar balance sheet and strong cash flow to gear up. The real interest of the dividend is in underlining what a bargain he got when he bought BHS three years ago for just GBP200m martin.dickson@ft.com."

The latest losses are part of the cost-cutting drive adopted by Richard Baker, who started as chief executive in September, that is intended to save GBP100m and turn the company round. Last year 500 jobs were lost at the company's corporate centre in Nottingham and more went when a factory in Scotland closed. Boots declined to confirm the numbers before informing staff. However, it said: ""There is an announcement and it will be about jobs. We have told our people that we are carrying out a strategic review and obviously it does involve cuts."" The announcement will be made with Boots's third-quarter trading statement on Friday. The company is predicted to have performed well on the shop floor, with analysts forecasting like-for-like sales growth of 2-4 per cent. It is a busy week for retail sector sales reports, which are expected to clear up confusion about the performance of the high street retailers over Christmas. Concern about a general downturn in retail sales was partially dispelled last week, when the Confederation of British Industry announced that volumes were much higher in the first three weeks of December than a year earlier. The CBI report suggested sales growth gained momentum during the month, and economists said official data for the whole month were likely to show solid improvement. Some analysts think the benefit of higher sales might have been undermined by price-cutting that would hit gross profit margins. Oriel Securities, the stockbroker, believes the climate is positive and the profits warning from WH Smith was a one-off. There are hopes of reassurance from Marks and Spencer's trading update on Wednesday. While it struggled early in December, its refusal to discount ahead of Christmas is expected to mean that a pick-up in sales during the last-minute consumer rush came with a good margin. Dixons, Britain's leading electrical retailer, will also announce its seasonal sales performance on Wednesday. The group, which has had two successive poor Christmases, is thought to have performed better this time - partly reflecting strong demand for DVD players and camera phones. On Thursday statements are due from a raft of retailers including GUS, parent of Argos; HMV, the book and music retailer; Woolworths and Carphone Warehouse. In food retailing, there are sales figures from J. Sainsbury today and from Tesco tomorrow."
"Factiva-20230329-1440 (4).rtf","Document FTCOM00020040117e01g0001j","16 January 2004","Stores pick over lesson of Christmas past.","843 words","Richard Baker was dismissive of the threat to Boots from the supermarkets as he unveiled the latest element in his overhaul of the health and beauty retailer. ""It was ever thus,"" sighed the former Asda man, referring to Tesco's announcement after Christmas that it was focusing its latest round of price cuts on health and beauty. But the lessons of the Christmas period suggest that he should not be so confident. The supermarket retailers - in particular Tesco - came out as the clearest winners from a period when sales growth was in short supply. Bad weather, an appetite for discounts and the ""sameness"" of many retailers all stocking similar products combined to make out-of-town, one-stop shopping the area of biggest growth. Overall, sales were effectively flat. Now, with many retailers predicting a lean 12 months for the sector, the successful supermarket chains are likely to use their scale, space and nimble business models to push for all the sales they can get. ""The lesson of Christmas is that the winners won by being best at what they do - and the losers only have themselves to blame,"" said one analyst. Apart from Tesco, Asda and Wm Morrison Supermarkets, other winners included Next, Carphone Warehouse and HMV Media. The big losers were WH Smith, Marks and Spencer and Austin Reed - each of which parted company with a senior retail figure as a result of their performance. Discount chains did not do well - and Matalan and Poundstretcher fared particularly badly - while J Sainsbury was the food sector's laggard. ""It was a Christmas where the performance of management made all the difference - good or bad,"" said another analyst. ""What is the difference between HMV and WH Smith, the difference between Next and M&S if it is not management? And those sort of differences only become more marked as you go into a tighter retail environment."" The tone for the big story of Christmas was set when WH Smith brought its trading statement forward by almost four weeks - and issued a profit warning. A botched promotional offer was compounded by supply problems and did more harm than good. In particular, the group was hit in entertainment, where sales fell by 3 per cent. This was the Christmas battle ground. With no real sales theme - no Harry Potter, no big new technology - shoppers stocked up on DVDs and CDs. With a strong series of titles, the supermarkets piled into the market, cutting costs dramatically. Specialist retailers followed suit with a combination of price cuts and multi-buy offers. ""What happened in entertainment shows the pattern for what happens whenever the supermarkets go into a new non-food market,"" said one analyst. ""They just go for everything they can get."" When it announced its sales performance this week, Tesco took the opportunity to up the ante with its competitors - announcing plans for an extra GBP1.7bn of investment in the business, most of it destined for the UK as the group attempts to increase its already dominant position. The performance of Tesco pointed to the two other big themes - the success of out-of-town stores and the prevalence of discounting. Argos, a star of Christmases past, said its out-of-town stores fared much better than those on the high street. ""There was a real lack of footfall on the traditional high street,"" said one person close to the group."" Analysts said the wet weather played its part, as did the relative lack of interest in clothes buying. As for discounting, nearly everybody took part. Gifts were the biggest area of competition - with many chains on multi-buy offers from the start. ""We have got much more value-orientated customers now than ever before,"" said one retailer. ""Things on special offer would fly off the shelf but as soon as you stopped the discount, the sales stopped."" Retailers said the Christmas trends of flat overall sales, demand for discounts and ferocious competition are set to continue through the year. Add to that big expected increases in the cost base, in particular wage price inflation, and operators are going to have to be sharp to survive. ""This quarter is going to be at least as tough as Christmas,"" said one leading retailer. ""As soon as the sales end, things are going very flat."" Another said many retailers had already become much more efficient - in particular in taking direct control of overseas sourcing. Further steps would now have to be taken. ""What you are seeing is a lot of the price advantage that people are getting from moving to direct sourcing effectively being competed away. These are tough times and they are going to get tougher."" It all means that those that did badly at Christmas are likely to continue to struggle. ""Unless you have got your business model right, things are going to be very tough,"" said a senior figure at one of the winning groups. ""Only the best will do well this year."""

Richard Baker, chief executive of the high street health and beauty retailer, announced the moves as he unveiled better-than-expected Christmas trading figures - with a sharp increase in discounts to shoppers failing to dent margins. Shares in Boots rose 42lp - or more than 6 per cent - to 700p. Boots said sales in the third quarter rose by 5.2 per cent. In the core high street chemists chain, they were 5.4 per cent higher. Like-for-like sales, the measure which strips out the effect of new store openings, rose by 4.1 per cent against analysts expectations of 2-3 per cent. ""We had a very good Christmas with a sixth consecutive quarter of good growth,"" said Mr Baker, who joined the group in September from Asda. ""But nobody here is under any misapprehension about the size of the task ahead."" Mr Baker said there had been no rise in customer numbers - but those coming through had been tempted to spend more because of more aggressive promotions and pricing. On gifts, a three-for-two offer and a greater focus on health and beauty packs led to a 10 per cent increase in sales. Boots has cut the prices of 1,500 items - representing about 12 per cent of counter sales - by an average of 16 per cent. Mr Baker pledged to continue with the price-cut programme but refused to say whether prices would be cut further or the promotion would be extended to other lines. The moves on price are just part of measures designed to make the group more competitive. On Thursday, Mr Baker announced that 900 jobs would go from a head office staff of 3,000 to cut unnecessary bureaucracy. On Friday, he switched the focus to the stores, saying they would be opening for longer hours to meet changing shopping patterns. Community chemists will open to reflect local surgery hours, convenience stores will open when needed and more stores will open on Sundays. Boots said the changes would cost GBP4m ($7.2m) in the fourth quarter and GBP16m-GBP20m in a full year. The fourth-quarter investment in prices will cost GBP5m. Within the store performance, like-for-like sales of health products rose by 6.4 per cent, beauty and toiletries by 4.2 per cent and baby, photo and food fell by 1.4 per cent. Sales at Boots Healthcare International, which makes such products as Nurofen, Clearasil and Strepsils, rose by 13.6 per cent. Analysts trimmed forecasts for full-year pre-tax profit from GBP590m to GBP560m (GBP509m) to reflect the GBP30m costs of the head office reorganisation."

Richard Baker (pictured), the former Mars and Asda executive, who took the top job in September, has launched an immediate plan to modernise the health and beauty retailer. Head office is being slashed by 30 per cent. Opening hours are to be extended and prices cut in an attempt to rid the chain of its poor value image. But is it simply a burst of energy that will, as before, get bogged down in the reality of Boots' structural problems? The retailer defines the word maturity. It already had 1,000 stores in 1933. The 1,400 it runs today leave few gaps for adding new space. That leaves Boots reliant on like-for-like sales growth or margin improvements to drive profits forward. Christmas sales growth did outstrip rivals. Keener pricing and better core retailing skills will allow Boots to maintain that performance for a time. But prices will have to keep coming down if the group wants to arrest a long-running slide in the number of shoppers visiting its stores. That spells pressure for Boots' juicy margins - something that the aggressive push of supermarkets into non-food ranges will only increase. Boots is too complex a business simply to play the value card, which would be Mr Baker's first instinct after his time at Asda. Customers do value Boots' extra service, own-brand ranges and loyalty card. Coupled with the convenience of its locations for small purchases, the chain can charge a premium. But Boots' command centre has yet to give a clear signal on key issues such as whether it is willing to sacrifice margins to drive sales. Until then, investors who bid up the shares are still buying a dream."

The move comes in the wake of an announcement on Tuesday from the health and beauty retailer that it planned to cut almost a third of the jobs at its headquarters. Insiders warned there could be further heavy job cuts among the 2,100 staff remaining at the Nottingham site. The moves by Richard Baker show the impact he has had since he joined the business in September last year. A former Asda executive, Mr Baker has been taking steps to reduce the Boots head office bureaucracy and return more power to stores. On Thursday, he said the 900 jobs had to be cut at the core to make the business more modern, efficient and competitive. ""Boots operates in an extremely competitive environment, where pace of decision-taking and speed of implementation is integral to success,"" said Mr Baker. ""The proposed changes would reduce complexity and costs of head office functions, which improves our ability to compete."" Boots insiders said the job cuts were among white collar staff ranging from management to clerical roles. Posts are being cut across the organisation. One said: ""There were so many layers in the business that we had become too slow. We are now continuously looking at how we can modernise ourselves further and be more competitive. So never say never to more job cuts."" Some posts were cut last year. Friday's news on prices will come as Boots updates investors on its trading over the important Christmas and New Year period. The group is understood to have done relatively well, with a strong gift offer bolstering the core health and beauty lines. Mr Baker will be keen to capitalise on the changes he has made and the relatively stable trading performance of the group over the past few quarters. Friday's announcement will be part of an attempt to ensure that the business continues to drive forward in spite of the disruption of all the change. It comes in the wake of the announcement by Tesco earlier this month that it was gunning for Boots as it started another wave of price cuts. The supermarket chain cut prices from all areas of the store, but focused on health products such as multi-vitamins and healthy food ranges, baby products such as disposable nappies and changing mats, and beauty products."
"Factiva-20230329-1440 (4).rtf","Document FTCOM00020040116e01f0001h","15 January 2004","Tesco looks to small details to grow in Japan.","805 words","Foreign retailers have a mixed track record in Japan. Some, like the luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Prada, have been wildly successful. Others, such as Boots, the UK healthcare and beauty chain, have dipped their toe into the world's second-largest retail market only to beat a hasty retreat because of Japan's high costs and fastidious consumers. So when Tesco looked at entering Japan three years ago, the first thing the UK's leading supermarket group did was send a staff team to live with Japanese families and follow them around as they shopped, stored their purchases and prepared their meals. David Reid, deputy chairman of Tesco and head of its international operations, says it was crucial to understand Japanese consumers before taking the plunge. ""In America you have big cars, you can drive several miles in five minutes, you can buy in bulk and store it in your double-garage. Chalk and cheese compared to Japan. ""In Japan we learned that some housewives shop on bikes and shop daily, they visit six or seven shops looking for deals,"" he says. ""You've got to understand these things."" Tesco is hoping this attention to detail will ensure it makes the right decisions in Japan, its 10th market outside the UK. After detailed research and discussions with dozens of potential partners or targets, Tesco surprised the industry by acquiring a small, little-known discount chain called C Two-Network with about 80 shops around greater Tokyo. Tesco bought C Two last July for GBP139m ($253m). The company had sales of YEN54.3bn ($512,000) last year and operating profits of YEN3.9bn. The stores have young, dynamic staff, unusual in a country where seniority comes with age, and many retailers, such as Daiei, have fallen on hard times because of an inability to change. By opting for C Two, Tesco has departed from the successful hypermarket format of other foreign forays. The UK group has landed itself with a relatively unknown retailer and wholesaler centred on one vast city with a marginal share of the local market and one that will require heavy investment to build the business to a size comparable to its other overseas operations. Mr Reid says that although Tesco may switch to hypermarkets in Japan in future, it was not the right format for entry: ""We started obviously by looking at hypermarkets but the more we looked [the more] we decided it wasn't for us."" Mr Reid argues that the Japanese habit of shopping locally on a daily basis and Japan's densely populated cities precluded hypermarkets, the route taken by Carrefour of France when it entered Japan three years ago. Tesco also considered larger supermarkets but the sector is fragmented and littered with unprofitable chains. This approach was chosen by Wal-Mart of the US, which bought a stake in struggling retailer Seiyu in March 2002. Tesco narrowed its search to convenience stores and small supermarkets. ""We started to home in on that particular sector and we found C Two, which has an interesting business model: what I call a discount convenience format,"" Mr Reid says, impressed by C Two's high sales densities, aggressive pricing, its positive image with customers and low costs and capital. Tesco's strategy has its admirers. Roy Larke, editor of trade publication Japan Consuming, says: ""C Two alone will not make Tesco a leading retailer in Japan, but it does give it a solid base from which to experiment, and a base that is already established and knowledgeable about the market. This may well give Tesco a significant edge in the long run."" But a person at a rival foreign retail group in Japan says: ""It's hard to see how they can really grow with this. What Wal-Mart is doing in Japan is much more exciting. Large supermarkets and hypermarkets are the way to go and Tesco will eventually come to realise that, but it might be too late by then."" Because of C Two's small size, Tesco is widely expected to make further acquisitions, though Mr Reid indicates that they are not an immediate priority. ""We're not on a huge mission to charge into Japan. We've gone in cautiously. We're taking a bit of time to make sure we understand [C Two], how we can improve it, and once we've done that we'll look to see how fast we can expand it,"" he says. While the debate over Tesco's long-term future in Japan continues, at least the British group can take comfort from some Japanese symbolism: C Two's stores go under the name of Tsurukame, meaning the crane and turtle - both of which symbolise longevity to the Japanese."

Boots, the retailing group, was widely criticised following the recent reversal of its 2001 decision to switch its pension fund entirely into long-dated bonds. It plans to sell GBP425m of those bonds, or 15 per cent of the fund's assets, to take equity or hedge fund stakes. Some companies prefer their schemes to hold equities rather than bonds under the ""expected return on assets"" approach favoured by many actuaries. John Ralfe, former head of corporate finance at Boots, said it was not clear why trustees had increased risk without any obvious benefits for members. ""Moving GBP425m away from 100 per cent long-dated bonds increases the risk for Boots' members that their pensions will not be paid,"" he said. ""It contradicts what the trustees have told members and it contradicts actuarial valuations when the original decision was taken."" He also criticised the annual transaction costs of the switch which could be as much as GBP8m on a GBP400m hedge fund portfolio, compared with current total costs of GBP300,000. Mr Ralfe, w ho is a member of the Boots scheme, said inducements for trustees to increase risk could range from the offer of better benefits to a lump sum payment into the fund. Negative inducements could include threatening to close the scheme to new members or only funding the scheme at minimum legally required levels. He said there was no evidence of such pressure from Boots, but pointed out that the two-thirds weighting of employer-nominated trustees on the average pension board gave rise to a conflict of interest. In addition, the traditional approach of companies and funds pulling in the same direction on pensions was undermined by widening deficits. ""Most companies will make good deficits over 12 to 15 years, but the new pensions act gives trustees little leverage if a company wants to play hardball,"" said Mr Ralfe. Robin Ellison, of the National Association of Pension Funds, and Pinsents, the law firm, disagreed. He said: ""I don't believe trustees are powerless - if anything, they have too much power."" Jon Exley, of Mercer, the investment consultancy, said he was surprised at the Boots move. ""The irony is that many schemes want to move 100 per cent into bonds and wish they had managed the timing of it as well as Boots did in 2001."" Mr Exley, who advised on the Boots switch, said it was ""nonsensical"" to try to get rid of liabilities risk by taking more uncorrelated asset risks. ""Trying to diversify against mortality risk by investing in hedge funds and equities is a misunderstanding of the principles of diversification,"" he said. Donal McCabe, of Boots, said the trustees had decided independently to buy equities. ""This is merely tweaking the original decision - it's not possible to match longer-term liabilities against bonds since there isn't one that goes out far enough."""

In 2001, the Boots Pension Scheme became the first in the UK to invest the entirety of its assets in bonds, an unusual move while the average UK scheme held a 70 per cent weighting in equities. At the time, the trustees told members that the move, while unusual, was aimed at matching assets and liabilities and would reduce risk. The subsequent collapse of equities markets and the decline in interest rates has left the Boots scheme among the best funded in the UK. However, in May, Boots announced that it expected its pension expenses to rise next year and that it would switch 15 per cent of its portfolio into assets other than bonds. The announcement sparked concerns among some scheme members that the trustees had agreed to adopt a riskier investment strategy in the hope of earning higher returns that would enable Boots to limit its own pension contributions. In his letter, John Watson, chairman of the Boots Pension Scheme, sought to reassure members, saying: ""The pension fund remains well funded and, as a result of our decision three years ago to invest substantially in bonds, is in a very much better postion than the vast majority of those of other large companies."" However, the letter notes that an entirely bond-based strategy faces practical difficulties, particularly when it comes to matching liabilities to be paid in the very distant future. Therefore, a small portion will be invested in other assets while leaving ""the vast majority"" in bonds. ""I wish to reassure you that our continuing aim is to match assets to fund liabilities wherever possible,"" Mr Watson wrote."

The list of measures undertaken reads like a lesson in basic retailing. It includes such obvious steps as extending trading hours to capitalise on a core strength of convenience, simplifying supply lines, and even programmes to make sure that the too often empty shelves in stores are filled. The extent of remedial action reveals that this High Street staple has been even more badly run than many of its critics suspected. Investors were shocked when Boots's new management team signalled earlier this year the high cost of addressing structural problems and reversing years of underinvestment - not least a hit to margins from lower-priced products. But biting the bullet is necessary if Boots is not to simply wither away. Boots has sought to placate equity investors with its proposed share buy back of up GBP700m over the next two years - equivalent to about 14 per cent of the company's equity at current prices. Bondholders may be less impressed though at the subsequent credit rating downgrade. Equity investors still have an uncertain ride ahead. Boots will clearly benefit from better management but there are still execution risks. The restructuring may take longer and be more costly than expected. At the end of it, Boots still faces the problems of intensifying competition from supermarkets and generating growth from a mature domestic branch network. The new managers have a plausible recovery story to tell, but the incentive for short-term investors to buy into Boots is still weak."

The man with the Marbella tan and Monaco millions, who works hard and swears harder, would evidently head a listed company once more if his putative bid for Marks and Spencer materialises. As part of the highly leveraged package, he would apparently issue an equity stub, which some calculate might leave outside investors with as much as a 20 per cent stake. But Mr Green still bears scars from a whispering campaign against him in the City over Amber Day, the public company he headed from 1988 to 1992, which produced lower-than-forecast profits. He vowed never to get involved in public companies again. Twelve years and a string of successful deals later, he may be about to do just that. City investors, for their part, could find it hard to put shares in a company headed by Mr Green into their portfolios. There might be worries over leverage and there would need to be some very strong assurances on corporate governance. Mr Green and his associates would presumably own the majority of the equity, making it difficult for investors' voices to be heard. And Mr Green's larger-than-life personality tends to dominate his enterprises in a manner that sits uneasily with corporate governance conventions on boardroom balance. At the very least, institutional investors would want some very strong, respected personalities on the board as non-executives. But if the big institutions hesitate, bound by their investment rules, small shareholders seem unlikely to follow suit. Mr Green's recent record - in turning round BHS after buying it for a song and sharply improving profits at Arcadia - should guarantee him strong support among private investors. The City's loss could be their gain. Boots and bondage Has Boots' pension fund taken leave of its senses? Three years ago it was the pioneer and most radical advocate of the big shift from equities, selling its shares and moving into long-dated AAA bonds. On Thursday it said the trustees had decided to switch around 15 per cent of the assets into classes other than bonds to ""better match long-term liabilities"". John Ralfe, Boots' former head of corporate finance and the man who steered the move into bonds, immediately criticised Thursday's move on the grounds that it increased the riskiness of the scheme's investments. One cannot be sure of the precise effect because the company has not spelt out just what assets it is investing in. Equities certainly would be higher risk, as indeed would most other asset classes. Bonds, of course, are not entirely risk free unless their duration perfectly matches the time frame of payments to scheme members, and the Boots scheme is unlikely to be perfectly matched. Furthermore, changing life expectancy is hard to model into a bond portfolio, and the company said on Thursday that there were not enough sterling denominated bonds of sufficient maturity to cover expected long-run liabilities. But if Thursday's shift meant the replacement of bonds already in the portfolio by other assets, that would surely increase the risk profile without any evident increase in reward for trust members. The move could conceivably help the company by reducing its contribution costs, but that should be of no concern to the fund's trustees, who are there to protect the interests of scheme members and whose main concern should be an investment strategy that best guarantees their pensions. For the sake of the occupational pensions debate, it would be useful to be privy to their thinking. Wilde talk The ousting of Sir Clive Thompson was always likely to leave a huge charisma gap at Rentokil Initial. It was never more evident than at Thursday's annual meeting where several small shareholders gave brutal notices to the rather lumbering presentation by James Wilde, chief executive. He can hardly have been cheered by faint praise in defence from Brian McGowan, the new chairman: ""I would rather have someone who does the right thing for the business than a good speaker."" Indeed, the main problem is not with the messenger but with Rentokil's muddled message. There had been no disagreement over strategy at any board meeting, Mr McGowan claims, with careful precision, yet he is starting a total review of the business today. The cracks in the argument are too wide even for a smooth charmer like him to paper over. But Mr Wilde's unprepossessing public speaking is not entirely beside the point. Rentokil lacks a clear sense of direction or a ready answer to a shareholder's abuse of some of its directors as ""passengers"". After Mr Wilde's victory in his battle of wills with Sir Clive, Rentokil quickly needs to regain investors' confidence. And that means not only a coherent strategy but also dynamic delivery. martin.dickson@ft.com"

Boots said it was in early discussions on selling Durex's Play range of sex toys, including vibrators and massage oils. Garry Watts, chief executive of SSL, which owns Durex, said the group hoped to have its sex toy range, which is being extended, on Boots' shelves next year. Sales of sex toys have grown rapidly during the past five years, helped by the popularity of TV shows such as Sex and the City and the rapid growth of Ann Summers' ""passion and fashion"" stores, which now number 117 shops on UK high streets. By entering the market, Boots hopes to strengthen sales among its core female customer base. Boots says 88 per cent of UK women use its shops. According to the 2004 Durex global sex survey, it is mainly women who use such toys. Richard Baker, the former Asda man who took over as Boots chief executive last year, has launched a three-year turnround plan aimed at heading off competition from supermarkets and other high street chains such as Superdrug. Mr Baker wants to get back to basics at Boots by offering customers more health and beauty products at lower prices.

But the San Francisco healthcare technician does not want an ink-jet printer to go with his new Sony digicam. Printing pictures at home is too expensive, troublesome and time consuming, he says. Instead, he plans to take his memory card down to the local pharmacy for printing, just as he did with film. ""I want cheap, easy and convenient [printing],"" he explains. A growing proportion of digital camera owners are now agreeing with Mr Olender - raising the competitive stakes for retail outlets, traditional film manufacturers such as Fujifilm and Kodak, and home printer makers. While 75 per cent of digital photos were printed at home last year, this is expected to fall below 50 per cent by 2008, according to Lyra, a digital-imaging research group. And pharmacies and other retailers are expected to see their share of the digital print market rise from 14 per cent today to more than half. Retailers have three important advantages over home-printer companies in the market for photo printing. First, consumers are accustomed to dropping off film and picking up prints at a shop. Second, thanks to more advanced technologies and economies of scale, retailers can offer cheaper prints than home-printing enthusiasts can achieve. Wal-Mart, for example, charges 24 cents for a 4x6-inch print. By contrast, Hewlett-Packard, the leading ink-jet printer maker, says customers who buy economical bundles of photo-quality paper and ink can produce prints at home for 29 cents a copy. Third, retailers are starting to offer customised calendars, personalised invitations and other speciality products that they hope will encourage more printing. Consumers can already order personalised photo greeting cards from Shutterfly and Ofoto, the online print services, as well as photo albums with pictures and captions printed straight on to the pages. Pat King, general manager for consumer output at Kodak, says: ""We don't see the world being 4x6 prints forever."" The shift away from home printing began in earnest after last year's frenzied holiday shopping spree that pushed digital cameras into the mainstream - digital cameras outsold film cameras in the US for the first time in 2003. With roughly one in three US and Japanese households now owning digital cameras - a proportion that is likely to double by 2008 - technophobes are starting to outnumber enthusiasts. Early adopters may have fallen in love with the idea of editing and printing their own photographs, but casual snappers such as Mr Olender see it as a chore. This is good news for retailers such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy in the US and Boots in the UK. These groups had seen their film processing businesses decline as more people moved to digital, but were reluctant to invest in new digital printing equipment until they were confident the new cameras were moving into the mainstream. They are now investing heavily in digital photo-printing hardware to complement their traditional photo-developing franchises. It is also an opportunityfor film manufacturers such as Fujifilm, Kodak and Agfa to build new businesses as suppliers of digital mini-labs and kiosks to retail chains. Fujifilm predicted the shift to digital and developed mini-labs capable of processing and printing both film and digital prints with silver halide technology, which has long been the photographic standard (see below). Kodak, another mini-lab manufacturer, is also betting heavily on stand-alone kiosks that allow consumers to insert digital memory cards, select and edit photos, and print them out in seconds. Kodak says it has sold 55,000 kiosks worldwide, while Agfa, Sony and Fujifilm have also unveiled their own line of kiosks. At $13,000 versus up to $150,000 for a full-service, high-volume mini-lab, kiosks are a far more reasonable investment for retailers. They also take up much less space than traditional mini-labs. Market research groups say the surge in retail printing is unlikely to affect online services such as Ofoto and Shutterfly, by which customers can upload their pictures over the internet and receive prints in the mail a few days later. They predict that such services will retain their market share of about 7 to 9 per cent over the next few years. On the other hand, retail printing is certain to take business away from home ink-jet printer makers such as HP, Epson and Canon. Nonetheless, say research groups, the digital picture market will grow fast enough to allow them to achieve strong sales even while losing share. Lyra estimates that almost 213bn photos will be captured and saved by digital cameras in 2008. Roughly 31bn of them will be printed - more than three times the estimated 9.5bn digital images that were printed in 2003. This is important for home-printer manufacturers, which typically make more money by selling ink and paper than from sales of printers. Ron Glaz, analyst at IDC, the research company, says the challenge for HP, Epson and other printer makers is to make home printing easier. ""The key question is: how do they get people to print more?"" he asks. Printer makers acknowledge that while printing large batches of photos at home takes too long for most people, retailers cannot match the convenience of an ink-jet when consumers want to print a picture or two. Further, each new generation of printers brings faster printing speeds, they say, while the cost of supplies will fall. Some companies are also developing small printers that spit out 4x6 snapshots in seconds using dye-sublimation technology. Othershave introduced cameras that link directly with printers, cutting out the need for PCs. Still, one of the big drawbacks of home printing is the perception that it costs too much. In fact, printing full-page 8x10 photos is cheaper on an ink-jet unit than at most retail outlets, but most customers focus on the high up-front costs of home printing. Not only must they invest in the printing hardware, the argument goes, but they are also asked to fork out between $50 and $100 for ink and paper, depending on the brand and quantity. Many analysts believe technological advances and competition from retail print outlets will eventually push down prices of home-printing supplies. But as long as home printing is seen as time consuming and costly, new digital camera owners such as Mr Olender may be more inclined to opt for the retail alternative. Click here for last week's article on digital cameras PHOTO PRINTING TECHNOLOGIES - Silver halide: the standard method of printing photographic images, this process relies on special waterproof paper, one side of which is coated with silver-halide grains that are sensitive to red, green and blue light. The image is projected on to the paper and a latent image is formed in the exposed silver grains. Prints last a very long time. - Ink-jet: microscopic droplets of coloured ink smaller than the diameter of a human hair are deposited on to coated paper. At more than 1m droplets per sq inch, the quality can be comparable to silver-halide prints. HP claims photos printed with its new Vivera brand ink will last for more than 100 years. - Dye-sublimation: used in photo kiosks, dye-sublimation transfers solid coloured dyes from rolls of cellophane-like film to the surface of the photographic paper using a heated print head. Because the vaporised colours permeate the surface of the paper, these images are less vulnerable to fading and distortion over time. 38629929"

Sari BaldaufPresident of Nokia Networks A woman in a sea of male executives, Sari Baldauf sticks out year after year in the corporate photographs of Nokia's executive management team. In charge of the mobile infrastructure business as head of Nokia Networks, she has seen the mobile industry grow from 5m subscribers in 1988 to an estimated 1.7bn this year. A pioneer selling cellular systems with just a handful of staff in the 1980s, she now heads a business with more than 15,000 employees and sales this year estimated by analysts at about ?6.2bn (GBP4.3bn). Sitting in Nokia's glassand steel headquarters on the outskirts of Helsinki, Ms Baldauf has a strong presence. The 49-year-old Finn sees her selection as Europe's top businesswoman as an honour: as recognition not just for herself but, more importantly, for the team around her. ""Sometimes people heading businesses are too much in the spot- light,"" she says. Yet her position as a role-model for women in business is not one that she has always felt comfortable with. Speaking at a women business leaders' summit in 2002, she pointed to her own experiences. ""I have learned that the capacity to pull things through is not a gender-related issue. It's related to one's willingness to put one's personality on the line - to stick one's neck out. It is about guts - taking risks, stepping out of comfort zones."" In Finnish, it is about ""sisu"", a national characteristic she describes as a combination of ""persistence, guts, stubbornness and a non-assuming mindset"". Today Ms Baldauf is eager not to appear ungrateful or to belittle the award. But she suggests that, with the advancement of women in business, the concept of a separate league may soon be a thing of the past. ""I guess we are coming to the time and era when this perhaps needs to be revisited and we need to think whether it is the kind of thing you want to take separately."" But do her own experiences not suggest otherwise? After all, she was for 10 years the only woman on Nokia's executive management team. While women have reached positions in middle management, they remain thin on the ground at most senior levels. Ms Baldauf says things are changing. ""I think you will see a lot of women in top management going forward,"" she insists. But she also questions whether women are always so eager to move to the next management level. Women are often more realistic about what such jobs entail and about how a work-life balance can be achieved, she says. ""Perhaps women are more careful about that. They really think it through."" People are driven to take roles to conform to society's expectations rather than to fulfil their own priorities, she says. ""I think those kind of pressures at times are heavier on men than on women and quite honestly I think from this angle women have more freedom of choice."" Being in a technology-based company where engineers often hold sway has not been a problem, she insists. But perhaps it is a little easier for women to get on in Finland, a Nordic country where gender roles are not so clearly defined as in some southern European countries. ""If you look at Finnish culture, it's very egalitarian. In families everybody does their part - the work gets shared."" She has little time for the debate taking place in neighbouring Sweden and Norway, where the threat of legislation is being used to ensure greater female representation at board level. Diversity needs to be increased, but not by quotas, she says. However, it is not just the gender issue that makes Ms Baldauf a little uneasy at being singled out for an award. In a company with a strong emphasis on collective effort, it does not seem to fit in with the ""Nokia spirit"" that employees often refer to. Ms Baldauf herself has criticised the idea that business success can be achieved by a small number of ""superstars"". ""Leaders are too iconised and organisations personalised in one or a very few faces,"" she says. Of course, Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive, has been unable to avoid cult status as the man credited with transforming the Finnish conglomerate from a producer of televisions and rubber boots into Europe's leading technology group. But he has not been alone on the journey, surrounding himself from 1992 with a tightly knit group of executives of whom Ms Baldauf is one. Fourteen years later, the same names are still topping the company. From the working class town of Kotka, 50km from the Russian border, Ms Baldauf gained a masters degree in business administration at Helsinki School of Economics. After a brief spell with the Institute of Finnish Exports and then as marketing manager for Falcon Communications in Abu Dhabi, she joined Nokia in 1983. In 1988 she became head of the cellular business at a time when new GSM mobile standards were being established in Europe. She joined the group's executive management board in 1994 and while the company's infrastructure activities have often been overshadowed by its handset business - networks make up about 20-25 per cent of group sales - Nokia became one of the world's leading mobile network suppliers. But in 2001 the technology bubble burst. Overburdened with debt, telecoms operators slashed capital spending on infrastructure. From managing explosive growth, Ms Baldauf was now having to deal with the consequences of a market in free fall, with sales in the sector dropping 50 per cent over three years. In rival groups, new managers were brought in to administer the axe, but at Nokia it was Ms Baldauf who had to cut back the organisation she had nurtured, a task she describes as ""pain and sorrow work"". ""If I look at myself, what is most natural to me is being a team builder and developer. That's where I get the biggest sense of achievement and joy. But part of life is that things change. You need to understand the realities in the marketplace and you need to draw the conclusions, take the action and be able to execute."" What made the task more complex was that it came at a time when the industry was preparing for the transition from GSM to third generation (3G) mobile technologies. While cutting back on costs and reducing the network's workforce by about 7,500 over three years, Ms Baldauf also had to invest in a platform for future growth. The market is now recovering. The network division is back in profit and operating margins in the second quarter reached 16 per cent. ""I would say the dramatically difficult days are over, but the market remains highly competitive."" Ms Baldauf, who is single and does not have children, draws a sharp line between her public and private life. ""She is certainly not the kind who is going to open up her wardrobe to women's magazines,"" says one Finnish business observer. ""She is typical Nokia: highly respected but not an extrovert, a technocrat."" Ms Baldauf is involved with the International Youth Foundation, an educational group for disadvantaged children. She has been on the board of the global foundation since 2000. Her passion for classical music has led her to get involved in the Savonlinna Opera Festival and the Sibelius Academy, though she admits her favourite composer is not the Finn, but J.S. Bach. ""You need to make sure that you also take time to do things that are important for you and maintain your inner identity. I try to do that. ""I am Sari and then I work at Nokia. I have this role, and I have responsibilities and tasks that relate to that. But as a human being, I don't identify myself with that role. As a human being, I identify myself as Sari."" 2. Ana BotinPresident, Banesto Will Ana Patricia Botin, daughter of 69-year-old Santander patriarch Emilio, become the first woman to take over what is shaping up to be one of the world's most powerful banks? It has long been a favourite topic in Madrid's banking circles. But since Santander Central Hispano (SCH) looks poised to become Europe's fourth-largest bank by taking over Abbey National, other financial capitals are taking a close interest as well. Father and daughter are tight-lipped - discretion is one of the first commands of the Botin dynasty. The family, which is among the 10 richest in Spain, has been leading Santander for three generations, even though it only holds a 3 per cent stake. Since 1909, there has been an Emilio Botin at the helm of Spain's largest bank. Emilio III is due to retire in three years' time and, when he does, Ana Patricia could succeed him. Many observers say that the 43-year-old has what it takes. After studying in the US - at Bryn-Mawr women's college and Harvard - she worked her way up at JP Morgan, the US investment bank, before returning to Santander. ""I have started at the bottom,"" she says. ""Nobody has given me anything."" Her critics question this. They say that she has survived, despite losing Santander a substantial sum of money with a too- rapid expansion of the bank's Latin American operations between 1994 and 1999. When Santander merged with Banco Central Hispano, Mr Botin took seriously the opinions of its new partner, which objected to the family's strong influence. As a consequence, Ms Botin had to leave. She then worked on establishing an internet consulting company. But for the past two years, Ana P - as she is called by colleagues - has been back, running Banesto, the SCH subsidiary many regard as the jewel of the bank. In the first half of 2004, Banesto's net profit rose 12 per cent to ?270m (GBP185m). Since the beginning of 2003, the bank has won 10,000 small- and medium-sized business customers every quarter. Ms Botin speaks five languages and she typically works a 14-hour day. 3. Valerie Gooding Chief executive, Bupa As chief executive of an unlisted company, Val Gooding rarely features in the press. But the work of Bupa, Britain's leading provider of health and care services, touches peoples' lives every day in a fundamental way. Bupa has 4m members in its insurance schemes and it maintains 36 hospitals in the UK and Ireland. More than 25,000 people live in its 300 care and retirement homes. At the helm since 1998, Val Gooding, 54, has cemented Bupa's lead in a rapidly expanding market which is set to benefit from both government policies and a greater affluence and health awareness among the population. Ms Gooding says she is very proud of Bupa's business performance - operating profit has grown by 27 per cent a year over the past five years - but even prouder of the work that her staff do on a daily basis. ""It may sound like a cliche, but many of the people who work at Bupa are doing really exceptional things,"" she says. To familiarise herself with the concerns of staff and customers, Ms Gooding usually spends half her time ""on the ground"" - in care homes in the UK or visiting Bupa's overseas operations. ""I like spending time in call centres listening in to what people's concerns are,"" she says. ""In health and care you can never be perfect. The thing we are interested in is improving the quality of our service and serving more people."" She plans to maintain growth by taking advantage of consolidation in the UK market for homes for the elderly. The sector is highly fragmented: Bupa, the largest player, only accounts for 5 per cent of the market. Ms Gooding's career began at British Airways, where she held a variety of roles until she became entrusted with a portfolio of subsidiaries. She admits it was there that she acquired ""a taste for running things"". This, she says, made her susceptible to a call from a headhunter who wanted to recruit her to the Bupa board in 1996. Two years later, she became chief executive. Her colleagues know her as hard-working. But she is ""a great advocate of more flexible working for women, especially early in their career"". Bupa tries to set an example by offering flexible hours for its large number of female workers. 4. Rose Marie BravoChief executive, Burberry Burberry was a British raincoat manufacturer whose brand had seen better days until Rose Marie Bravo, a workaholic American, arrived to revive its tired plaid image. Since being named chief executive seven years ago, Ms Bravo has convinced the fashion cognoscenti that the brand is a must-have. She has transformed it into a fully-fledged luxury goods group with a good record of growth. The 53-year-old, who was formerly president of Saks Fifth Avenue and who introduced Gucci, Jil Sander and Prada to the chain, was well placed to bring fresh ideas and innovation to Burberry, a brand that had suffered years of neglect. She livened up its famous beige check with daring pink variations and she put it on everything from bikinis to shoes. Proclaiming a plaid revival, she has also introduced non-logo lines in a bid to attract new customers. One of Britain's best-paid women, she dispenses a good dose of common sense backed by impeccable taste. Her role models when she was growing up included Estee Lauder, Helena Rubenstein and Elizabeth Arden, all of whom created their own companies. Now she serves on the boards of the Estee Lauder Companies and Tiffany &Co, as well as on the Burberry Group board. She is also a trustee of Fordham University, her alma mater, in New York's Bronx, where she grew up. One of her biggest career breaks came in 1987, when she worked at Macy's, the US retail chain. She was promoted from senior vice-president of merchandising to chairman and chief executive of its new acquisition, the California-based chain I. Magnin. Her turnround at Burberry has become such a textbook example of how to transform a business that other luxury goods companies are sometimes said to be ""doing a Burberry"". In May, Burberry smashed through full-year forecasts with a rosy performance. It promised more of the same. Two months later, as the group reported strong first-quarter turnover, Ms Bravo agreed to extend her contract by another year until 2006, a move that is likely to cheer Burberry's investors. 5. Marie EhrlingPresident, TeliaSonera Sweden Marie Ehrling is the most powerful businesswoman in Sweden. Ms Ehrling's high-flying business career began in 1982, when she joined SAS, Sweden's national airline. Nineteen years later, she became deputy head of the group. But with the top job in sight, she had left SAS in 2002 after losing a power struggle with Jorgen Lindegaard, the group's chief executive. Her move to the helm of telecommunications group TeliaSonera's Swedish operations reinforced her reputation as one of Sweden's smartest career strategists. She left SAS at the beginning of a financial crisis - one which the airline has still not entirely overcome. 2001 was perhaps the most challenging year of her career. A painful antitrust scandal was only pushed out of the headlines by the terrorist attacks on the US, which threw the whole industry into disarray. A few weeks later, an SAS aircraft crashed at Milan airport in the worst accident in the airline's history, incurring 100 casualties. Soon afterwards, attention turned to management bonuses at a time when the airline sacked 10 per cent of its employees. Ms Ehrling, 49, handled the public scrutiny well, with the Swedish press praising her for her ""calm and professional"" manner. She was promptly named Sweden's businesswoman of the year. ""Ms Ehrling is very realistic, she communicates well with everyone. That has always helped her,"" says Martin Kreuger, editor of Chef, a Swedish business magazine. These skills are also in evidence in her current job at TeliaSonera, a group that is the product of a merger two years ago between Sweden's Telia and Finland's Sonera. So far, her track record at TeliaSonera is good, with a significant increase in operational profits last year. But there are still plenty of challenges. One of the biggest of these is to reduce the company's headcount - there are 11,000 employees - and to close or sell unprofitable operations at the former state monopoly. Ms Ehrling will need all her mediation skills to keep on board her two biggest shareholders - the Swedish and Finnish governments. 6. Clara FurseChief executive, London Stock Exchange When Clara Furse was appointed chief executive of the London Stock Exchange over three years ago, she became the first woman to head the exchange in its 203-year history. The 47-year-old former managing director of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, the derivatives trading firm, arrived with little experience of the stock market, moving into the job after a year of turmoil at the exchange. Born in Canada of Dutch parents, Ms Furse started her career as a broker and has spent most of her 25 years in the City of London in financial derivatives. She is regarded as forceful and has guided the exchange profitably through the worst bear market in recent memory. But she has also met with defeat. As a former deputy chairman of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, she failed to snap up the exchange when it came up for sale shortly after her arrival, losing out to Euronext, its rival. 7. Guler SabanciChairwoman, Sabanci Holding Guler Sabanci is something of an institution in her country. Following the death of her uncle, Sakip Sabanci, earlier this year, she took up the reins as chairwoman of Sabanci Holding, the family-owned industrial group, becoming the first woman in Turkey to head a large corporation. Before taking over, she headed the group's tyre and reinforcements division. Under her watch it had grown into a multi-regional alliance in Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Today the empire spans tourism, textiles, food, tobacco and banking. She is at ease in an environment outsiders might see as dominated by male social mores, and has served on the board of Tusiad, the industrialists' association. Through her involvement with the Sabanci Foundation, she set up a private university. Observers say her biggest challenge is to focus on the conglomerate at a time when such large, disparate groups are not seen as viable and no longer enjoy protectionist economic policies. 8. Wanda RapaczynskiChief executive, Agora Wanda Rapaczynski's life story is full of sudden twists and new beginnings. Now chief executive of Agora, eastern Europe's largest quoted publisher, she left her native Poland at the age of 21 after a period of resurgent anti-Semitism in the country. After settling in the US, she first embarked on a career in academic psychology before eventually moving into management. When communism crumbled and the first free elections took place in Poland, she had become vice-president for new projects at Citibank. But Ms Rapaczynski eventually moved back to Poland and observers say that the influence of her experience in the rise of Agora - which now owns 29 local radio stations, 14 magazines and an advertising agency - can hardly be overestimated. The group went public in 1999, making some of its staff - including Ms Rapaczynski - multi-millionaires. Its current market capitalisation is ?700m ($863m). 9. Nancy McKinstry Chief executive, Wolters Kluwer Nancy McKinstry, the only woman to lead a big Netherlands corporation, faces a formidable task. As chief executive of Wolters Kluwer she has to revive the specialist publishing group that last year turned in the worst performance in its history. But she is optimistic. ""I love solving problems. There aren't any unsolvable problems,"" says the US executive, who took over from Rob Pieterse 13 months ago. Ms McKinstry, a New Yorker, has already initiated a wide-ranging restructuring programme that will result in 1,600 job cuts over three years and the divestment of non-core businesses. Although she could be considered an outsider by nationality, she knows Wolters Kluwer inside out, having spent 13 years with the publisher in the US. Her husband, a physician in New York, travels to Amsterdam every fortnight. At the beginning of the year, Ms McKinstry also took up a position on the board of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group. 10. Pat O'DriscollChief executive, Northern Foods When Northern Foods, one of the UK's largest food producers, was looking for a new chief executive last year, the chief criterion was to find somebody who had turned round a business. Pat O'Driscoll quickly emerged as a strong candidate. As head of the European retail management team at Shell, the oil group, she was responsible for transforming a business with $35bn annual sales and 13,000 forecourts in 20 countries. She did so in great style, returning the UK operations to the number one position in the domestic market. Born in Zimbabwe in 1959, she began her career as an accountant with Price Waterhouse after graduating in sociology from Exeter University. Ms O'Driscoll, who started at Northern Foods in March 2003, has already made changes, announcing 1,000 job cuts and two plant closures. But challenges remain, including the price pressures applied by big supermarkets that have led Northern Foods to issue a string of profit warnings in recent years. 11. Amelia Fawcett Vice-chairwoman, Morgan Stanley Europe Amelia Fawcett, an American with a legal background, has been an influential factor in the rise of Morgan Stanley's European business to its current status as the number one merger and acquisition investment bank. She joined the bank as a lawyer but proved so adept at banking that she was promoted to vice-chairwoman of Morgan Stanley in Europe in 2002. Ms Fawcett has a reputation for being a hard hitter but she is also regarded as something of a ""do-gooder"". She is very active in public life and serves as chairwoman of the UK National Employment Panel. She also works with a range of charities in the East End of London. Born in Boston and educated at Wellesley, the elite women's college, Ms Fawcett began her career in New York with Sullivan and Cromwell, a law firm. She then moved to the Paris office of the same company, from where she joined Morgan Stanley in London. She now has dual citizenship. 12. Sly BaileyChief executive, Trinity Mirror Sly Bailey has a reputation for decisiveness. Earlier this year, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, the UK's largest newspaper publisher, put an end to mounting criticism of the Daily Mirror, the group's flagship national paper. She sacked Piers Morgan, the tabloid's controversial editor who had given his approval to the publication of fake photographs showing British soldiers allegedly abusing prisoners in Iraq. Ms Bailey, 42, is no stranger to tough decisions. When she took the helm in February 2002, she introduced a reorganisation and cost-cutting programme that is expected to save the group GBP18m ($32.4m) this year, rising to GBP30m by 2005. Ms Bailey's media career began in 1984, when she joined the UK's Guardian newspaper as a sales executive. She then moved to IPCand rose up the ranks to become chief executive in 1999, aged 37. Two years later, she completed the sale of IPC to Time Inc, the publishing division of Time Warner, the world's largest media group, for GBP1.15bn. 13. Francoise Gri Chief executive, IBM France An IBM veteran of 23 years, Francoise Gri is in charge of one of Big Blue's most important country divisions. Two of the six manufacturing plants the US computer giant maintains in Europe are in France and the French unit's 13,000 staff generate an annual turnover of ?4bn ($4.9bn). Ms Gri joined International Business Machines France as a humble sales representative in 1981 but rose fast and became sales director for the public sector 10 years later. She laid the foundations for her further ascent in the newly founded e-business solutions unit in the mid-1990s, where she was in charge of sales and marketing. She was appointed chief executive of IBM France in August 2001. An ENSI graduate, Grenoble, she is a board member of the Institut de l'Entreprise and SFIB, French association of IT companies. She supports a government campaign to promote the domestic usage of computers. Last year, she received the Ordre National du Merit. 14. Gail Rebuck Chairman and CEO, Random House Group Much of what the UK and Europe reads crosses Gail Rebuck's desk at some point. As head of Random House UK, she leads the country's largest trade publisher with some of its best-known authors. In the year to September, Random House books made up 60 per cent of the UK bestseller lists. Ms Rebuck herself reads a large part of the 1,500 books that Random House UK publishes every year. Their authors include Robbie Williams and Bill Clinton, as well as novelists Philip Roth and John Grisham. She is responsible for 30 imprints, including Jonathan Cape, Heinemann, Arrow, Vintage and Corgi paperbacks, and manages a backlist of classics including the works of Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and Sigmund Freud. A Londoner who attended the city's French Lycee, Ms Rebuck started her career as a production assistant. She was already chairman and chief executive of Random House when the publisher was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998. 15. Kate SwannChief executive, WH Smith After a stormy honeymoon, Kate Swann is emerging as a strong leader at WH Smith, the 212-year-old British stationery and newsagent chain. The 39-year-old became chief executive at the retailer in November last year. Previously she was managing director of Argos, the UK's leading general merchandise retailer. The first months at WH Smith were not easy. One of Ms Swann's initial moments in the limelight came with a profit warning in January. Then, nearly one-third of investors opposed her pay package. In August, Permira, the buy-out firm, was circling the retailer but eventually walked away without making an offer - allegedly because of WH Smith's large pension deficit. However, a strategy update in August was well received. Investors are also delighted about the sale of WH Smith's Hodder Headline publishing arm. The proceeds will largely be handed back to shareholders, but they will also help with the pension deficit. 16. Barbara KuxChief procurement officer, Royal Philips Electronics Barbara Kux has criss-crossed Europe in her career. The latest stop on the professional journey of the 50-year-old Swiss is Eindhoven, the Netherlands, where she runs procurement for Royal Philips Electronics, the Dutch group. In the job since last year, she juggles a ?20bn ($24.6bn) annual budget and relationships with more than 50,000 suppliers. Previous jobs took her to Cologne, where she was executive director of Ford Europe, and Poland, where she was country manager for Nestle, the world's biggest food group. She has overseen the eastern European operations of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish turbine maker, and worked for McKinsey Germany, the management consultancy. Ms Kux, who has a Dutch spouse, revealed her own priorities last year when, in an interview, she attested to her Swiss compatriots' lack of daring and vision and narrow-minded perspective. According to colleagues, she has lost a lot of her Swissness on her grand tour of Europe. 17. Dominique Heriard DubreuilChairman of the board, Remy Cointreau Group Sales of Remy Cointreau's flagship cognacs were still reeling from the Asian crisis when Dominique Heriard Dubreuil became chairman and chief executive of the venerable French drinks group in 1998. She was an unlikely candidate to succeed her father, having avoided the family business in the early stages of her career. But she quickly established herself as one of France's few female grands patrons. She tackled the group's large annual loss by selling off marginal assets while focusing sales on core brands. She also acquired Bols Royal Distilleries of the Netherlands to reduce Remy Cointreau's reliance on cognac. French analysts say Ms Heriard Dubreuil's international perspective has been crucial in cementing Remy Cointreau's position as a worldwide luxury group. For example, she established a worldwide distribution joint venture in 1999 with Highland Distillers and Jim Beam Brands. 18. Jil Sander Creative director, Jill Sander Jil Sander is as sober and understated as the fashion she designs. ""It emerged that I wasn't so easily replaceable,"" she offered as an explanation when she returned to the fashion group bearing her name as chief designer in 2003. Ms Sander had left the company in 2000 after falling out with Prada Group, the Italian group to which she had sold 75 per cent of her holding. Her change of mind was triggered by the company's financial mess. This was prompted by the failure of some of the designs that were produced by the company after it was acquired by Prada. Traditional customers had been alienated by strong colours and sporty cuts. Industry insiders have been impressed with how quickly the new collections by the ""Queen of Clean"" or ""Lady of Less"", as she is known, have managed to counter the trend of falling sales. In the first half of this year, turnover grew by 4 per cent to ?65.4m ($80.5m). 19. Ruth Anderson Member of the board, KPMG UK Ruth Anderson is used to being first. The high-flying corporate tax accountant was the first woman to be appointed to the board of a big professional services firm in the UK. That was back in 1998. Ms Anderson's clients include some of the best-known names in the UK construction and development sector - among them Kier, the international construction group, and Berkeley, the luxury developer. She is also responsible for Boots, the chemist chain. Ms Anderson is KPMG's board member in charge ofdiversity, leading the firm's efforts to recruit from previously under- represented groups. She has established networking events for women, believing women lack the natural networking structures men have developed over the years. Born in Northern Ireland, she studied French and Spanish at Bradford University before joining KPMG in 1976. She was made a partner in 1989. 20. Isabel Aguilera NavarroChief operating office, NH Hotels Isabel Aguilera Navarro is chief operating officer of NH Hoteles, Europe's third largest business hotel chain. The 43-year-old has risen to the upper echelons of corporate Spain. An architect by training, she started her career in the computer industry, working with Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Olivetti. In 1997 she moved to Dell and a year later was appointed head of the US computer giant's operations in Spain, Portugal and Italy. ""After four years at Dell, I had achieved all my goals,"" she says. In 2002, she moved to NH Hoteles, which was struggling after September 11 2001. The group has come through the downturn well, announcing a 35 per cent increase in first-half earnings in July. Ms Aguilera Navarro has responded to the increasing number of female business travellers with an act of moral and practical support: she has made sure that NH Hoteles offers more skirt hangers. Understatement and fashion are not usually a good match in Italy. But that was before Miuccia Prada dreamed up her minimalist chic designs, revolutionising the Milan fashion house set up by her grandfather in 1913. Since she entered the family business in the early 1970s, the fiery 54-year-old designer has won catwalk acclaim and awards, including an honorary doctorate from London's Royal College of Art for her innovative use of materials. Branded as an intellectual designer, she graduated in political science and took a course in mime at Milan's Piccolo Teatro, once joking it was an excuse not to talk. Successful new women's and men's wear collections have been followed by the opening of state-of-the-art stores around the world, including Hong Kong and Los Angeles this year. A priority of the luxury goods company has been to tackle its debt, which it aims to reduce to less than ?300m ($370m) by the end of the year. Prada is also looking at a stock market listing in the first half of next year. 21. Miuccia Prada Designer, Prada Group Understatement and fashion are not usually a good match in Italy.

Cristina Stenbeck Vice-chairman Investment, AB Kinnevik Cristina Stenbeck was 24 years old when the sudden death of her father obliged her to take control of one of Sweden's great family business empires. It was not just her youth and inexperience that made her task unusually challenging. It was also the scale of the Stenbeck empire, which has a turnover of SKr5.6bn ($763m) and whose companies include Tele2, the pan-European telecoms operator, and Metro International, the world's biggest free newspaper group. But Ms Stenbeck, now 26, has answered the doubters, presiding over a period of consolidation. She has sought the counsel of Pehr Gyllenhammar, former head of Volvo, who is chairman of Investment AB Kinnevik. Before her appointment, Ms Stenbeck worked for Polo Ralph Lauren in New York for two years. She reportedly attended her first management conference at the family company the age of 14 and was elected a deputy board member at 19. 23. Belinda EarlChief executive, Jaeger Just a few weeks into the job as chief executive of Jaeger, Belinda Earl wants to bring fresh life into the upmarket fashion brand. ""Jaeger had lost its way a few years ago,"" she says, but under the new ownership of Harold Tillman she plans to ""build it up"". The former head of Debenhams, the department store group, Ms Earl wants to broaden Jaeger's appeal to attract 35-year-olds as well as its more traditional 45-year-old customers. She is also planning to focus on accessories, jewellery and homeware. Her rise to the top has been steady rather than rapid. She started her career at Harrods before moving to Debenhams' buying and merchandising team in 1985, joining the board 14 years later. Wooed by several retailers when a colourful takeover battle for Debenhams by a private equity consortium left her out of a job in December, Ms Earl was also offered positions in other sectors. But with retail in her blood she did not succumb. 24. Mary Jo GresensChief financial officer, INA Schaeffler Not many female or foreign managers make it into German boardrooms, let alone at family-owned engineering companies. The exception is Mary Jo Gresens, an American who is chief financial officer at INA Schaeffler, one of the world's leading makers of vehicle components. Three years ago, Ms Gresens and Jurgen Geissinger, her boss, staged Germany's first hostile takeover of a quoted company by a privately owned rival: INA Schaeffler swallowed FAG Kugelfischer. The deal took less than six weeks to complete and - at ?732m - amounted to less than a third of FAG's annual turnover. Afterwards, Ms Gresens said: ""That was practically a dream deal."" An engineer by training, Ms Gresens joined INA Schaeffler after 23 years in the automotive industry, with spells at Ford and Volkswagen, where she worked on developing new models. She once said: ""I'm in the lucky position of understanding the numbers and the technology."" 25. Eva CastilloPresident, Merrill Lynch Spain There was a time when Spain was not ""busy"" enough for Eva Castillo, manager of Merrill Lynch's Spanish business. In 1992, as an ambitious 29-year-old, she thought the Spanish economy would take too long to catch up with globalisation - so she moved to London to work with Goldman Sachs. But Madrid changed dramatically in the mid-1990s, and Ms Castillo has not regretted her move back five years later. Ms Castillo quickly shot to prominence there, partly because of her decision to pull the planned flotation of Fadesa because she doubted the valuations of the Spanish property group's owners. Last year, she proved her decisiveness in an internal power struggle in Merrill's Madrid office, which resulted in the departure of Jaime Bergel, the then president of the bank's Spanish operations. The bank's official version of events is that Mr Bergel was looking for new business challenges. But Ms Castillo now does his job. 38127239"

For consumers of bunion pads and anti-dandruff shampoo this hopefully holds true. But for shareholders in the UK high street chemist, a more appropriate motto might be ""lower margins you'll hate"". Thursday's update showed first half like-for-like sales broadly in line with expectations. Margins however slipped by 1.8 percentage points year on year around 0.5 percentage points worse than targeted. Boots blames price cuts and that usual suspect, the weather, which in Boots' case reduces sales for high-margin suntan products. Management argues that the absolute profit miss, of GBP10m is small relative to their GBP2bn revenue base and their endeavours to restructure Boots. Yet it is symptomatic of the wider dilemma. Years of under-investment and strategic hyperactivity mean the main remedy available is to spend more money on some fairly basic things. More tills. More Staff. Lower prices. But it is not certain that these ultimately will increase profit. In this respect Boots has done itself few favours by maintaining full year profit targets despite the weak first half. Further out, analysts estimate 18 per cent operating profit growth in 2006, despite the flat performance expected this year. The sense remains that financial forecasts and the gritty reality of turning Boots around have yet to converge. This feeling is enhanced by management's decision to spend this year only half of the GBP700m earmarked for share buybacks. Perhaps they think they will still get the shares cheaper. For now, lower prices and Boots sit well on the shelf together. 38119942"

The UK retailer, which is fighting to recover from losses and increasing competition from supermarkets, said margins had fallen by 50 basis points. Fears of a possible possible profits squeeze caused the shares to slide by 31lp, or 5 per cent, to 630p in early trade. Boots blamed some of its margin problems on the poor summer weather, which had left suntan lotion languishing on the shelves. Like-for-like sales in the core Boots The Chemist did move up by 3.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year, but this compared with a 4.4 per cent increase in the first quarter. The strongest growth in the quarter came from healthcare, where like-for-like sales were up by 6.1 per cent in the period, driven by a good performance in dispensing as health conscious customers snapped up vitamins and supplements. Like-for-like sales in beauty were also strong, up 4.5 per cent, despite the rain hit sales of tanning lotions, as premium cosmetic sales grew and shoppers took advantage of the ""Lower Prices You'll Love"" promotions. Food sales rose by 5 per cent, while babycare products increased sales by 7 per cent on the back of new ranges in clothing and accessories. Richard Baker, chief executive, praised the group's efforts to date but said there was no room for complacency. ""We have made substantial progress in the first half but much of what we planned to achieve in the year, including another good Christmas, falls in the second half and therefore there is still a great deal to do."" Boots has undertaken a number of defensive measures to help stave off supermarket competition including deeper price cuts and extended opening hours. It has also sought to rigorously reduce costs and get back to its core business. Earlier this month it announced the closure of its non-core dentistry, laser hair removal, chiropody, laser eye correction business. The closures came on the heals of the cutting of 900 jobs from its head office at the beginning of the year and last year's closures of its Wellbeing Centres and Pure Beauty chain of shops. Shareholders were also offered a sweetener on Thursday when the group announced a share buy-back programme during its close period, which runs from October 1 to October 27. 38114360"

What If!, a London-based ""innovation company"", topped the FT's Best Workplaces in the UK rankings the other week, I thought I'd take a closer look. After ten 10 minutes of research, I became concerned. Clearly, my colleagues had made a rare error and got entries for Best Workplaces mixed up with entries for a forthcoming survey of Silliest Workplaces. ?What If!'s company name, abbreviated to just ?! in official literature, was just the beginning of the daftness - there was also the fact that the chairman is known as Chief Enthusiast, the director of operations as ""Big Daddy"", and other WhatIfers (?!ers in print) by titles such as Firestarter and Fluff Fairy. Even more preposterously, it was impossible to work out what ?! actually did to make money. ""?! is a strongly values-led organisation, with everyone aligned behind the five values: Love; Passion; Action; Bravery; and Freshness,"" explained some PR blurb, unhelpfully. I arranged a visit to investigate further. As it happened, On the day of my appointment, I was being shadowed by Chris Hinton, an engineering and quality manager from Ford - the second half of a job swap arranged by the Campaign For Learning. He looked wary when I explained that we would be spending the day talking to Fluff Fairies, glancing back as if to say ""I see why they call you the pink 'un"". And he seemed no less wary as we entered ?!'s offices, off Marylebone High Street. From where we sat in the reception area, we could see a massage ball, a big red bed, a stuffed Dalmatian, a kitchen area offering free tea, coffee and breakfast cereals to staff, a highly addictive toy called Bopit and a poster proclaiming the company's ""Big Hairy Audacious Goals"". Chris said it felt more like someone's home than an office. To me, it felt more like an infants school. And, as the only people in suits, Chris and I looked like we had just arrived for a parents evening (I have since discovered that ?! does actually host an annual parents day for the mums and dads of ?!ers). We were greeted warmly by Sal Pajwani, the 40-year-old managing director of ?! of the small thirteen13-year-old company. He would have taken us to his office, except, of course, he ""hot desks"" - and goes one step further by not even having a computer, working instead on a Blackberry carried in the pocket of his combats. We ended up in a meeting room furnished with a long red sofa, pink cushions and bean bags. In an attempt to look less uptight, I went for one of the bean bags, but ended up with my bum in the air. Sal gently suggested sitting on the sofa instead and, as I recovered, Chris got straight to the point: what did ?! do? He made engines for a company that sold cars. What did ?! do to make money? ""The simple answer is we do innovation,"" replied Sal. And what does that involve? ""Thinking about the world in new ways and offering up commercial or non-commercial ways of making the world a better place."" Sorry? ""Well, our field is thinking up solutions that people haven't thought of before."" So, they're consultants? ""Hmmm. I don't like that word. Let's just go with my terminology for a minute. Essentially we release the creative potential of clients..."" This conversation went on for some time. For an hour in fact. It was followed by an hour-long meeting with six ?!ers, who told us lots about why they loved working at ?!, but little about what it was that bankrolled their free kitchen and parents evenings. It was only at the end of our three hours at ?!, when we spent time with two ?!ers working on a project to come up with ideas for a new range of beauty products for Boots, that we got to the bottom of it. ""They're a consultancy, aren't they?,"" remarked Chris as we left. ""They help companies develop new brands and products and working practices. Why don't they just say that?"" Which is exactly the point. ?!'s concern with appearing innovative extends to language. They say that they don't like words such as ""manager, employee and staff"" because ""in our experience no one wants to be managed, they just want to be trusted to do their job"". They refuse to call themselves a consultancy. Like Prince during his squiggle phase, they even struggle with the concept of having a name. For a few years, I worked on the FT's Creative Business sectionsupplement and dealt with lots of ""creative"" agencies such as like ?!. Invariably, they were run by young men sporting moustaches with parts of them missing and invariably they considered themselves too trendy to explain what what they did. The fuzzier their work, the woollier they were in describing it. But it should be the other way around: the vaguer the function of a company, the more they should resort to conventional language. Otherwise they just disappear in a cloud of fluff - which is, unfortunately, what ?! do. Indeed, they are so bad at are explaining their work explaining their work that the first time I read about them, I couldn't decide whether they were a cult, some kind of philanthropic body or a business. So my message to ?! is: you have nothing to fear from terms such as like ""consultancy"", ""staff"", ""manager"" and ""chairman"". The worst that will happen is that strangers will find it easier to understand what you do and why it is that you are such a brilliant company place to work for - which, as my colleagues have already observed, you are. 42441035"

Having stalled in the previous session, the dollar initially moved very little yesterday, still hampered by what Wednesday's benign US inflation report might mean for interest rates. Caution remained after Hong Kong announced a new trading band for its currency, feeding speculation that China may be ready to revalue the renminbi. But a number of data releases were largely seen as dollar positive. Weekly jobless claims backed up the US growth scenario, as first-time unemployment benefit claimants fell to 321,000 in the week to May 14, from 341,000 in the previous week. Analysts said the numbers were consistent with a firming labour market and sustained jobs growth. Imports into the US from countries around the Pacific Rim in April appeared likely to unwind much of the narrowing of the trade deficit seen in March. Inbound container flows were up a seasonally adjusted 15 per cent, which was seen as representing imports worth between $3-4bn from the region. A widening trade deficit should be dollar negative, but the data also showed a healthy appetite for foreign goods. Dollar bulls welcomed this following Wednesday's inflation data which suggested that consumer spending may be slowing, and that the Fed may not have to increase interest rates as aggressively as previously thought. The dollar gained 0.1 per cent on the euro to $1.2620 by midday in New York, and was up 0.4 per cent to Y107.55 against the Japanese currency. Sterling was boosted in early London trade by retail sales data which appeared to contrast with the view that Britain was facing a high street slowdown. In April, retail sales gained 0.5 per cent month-on-month, against expectations of a flat reading. March's fall of 0.1 per cent however, was revised lower to a fall of 0.3 per cent. As high street chains around the UK, including most recently Boots, Sainsbury and Next, have reported falling profits and sales, most economists were expecting the latest numbers to be weak. The data however, were looking back to April and most strategists regarded them cautiously. ""The story on the UK economy has not changed by virtue of this release,"" said Daragh Maher, strategist at Calyon. ""With high street retailers not projecting any swift turnaround, and downside risks to spending from the housing sector still lingering, the rally in sterling will likely prove short-lived."" By midday in New York, sterling had eased from its earlier levels, but remained up 0.1 per cent at $1.8355 against the dollar. Against the euro, the pound managed to add 0.2 per cent to GBP0.6875. The euro was struggling on all fronts under the weight of data which continued to show the eurozone economy's slowing growth. Headline inflation in April remained unchanged for the third month in a row, and core inflation fell more than expected, while eurozone industrial production continued to fall in March. The Canadian dollar dipped against its US counterpart, but trade was muted ahead of last night's budget vote which could see the government forced into a federal election this summer. By midday in New York, the loonie traded a shade lower at $1.2632. * Reuters Spot Matching, which is the benchmark platform for trading US$/HK$, reported yesterday that trade on Wednesday rose 675 per cent over the 2005 average hitting an all-time high in terms of daily volume.

With chains around the UK, including most recently Boots, Sainsbury and Next reporting tumbling profits, many economists had expected the retail gloom to persist. But most areas posted a rebound from March's weakness - textiles, clothing and footwear rose 1.2 per cent after a 0.2 per cent fall in March. The numbers were swallowed with a pinch of salt by most analysts however. ""The story on the UK economy has not changed by virtue of this release,"" said Daragh Maher, strategist at Calyon.

Wednesday's benign US inflation report suggested that the Federal Reserve may not tighten rates as aggressively as some investors had feared. There was also continued speculation over the Chinese renminbi after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Wednesday announced the introduction of a new trading band, which some took as a signal that the People's Bank of China may be ready to move on its pegged currency. Finally, Park Seung, the governor of the Bank of Korea, sent a few jitters through the market after telling the Financial Times the central bank would no longer build its foreign exchange reserves. The bank later denied this, saying it would act in the market if warranted. The dollar was little moved against the euro at $1.2652, and held steady against the yen at Y107.12, promting speculation that the pause in its recent rally was only temporary. ""The market's relief in the aftermath of the US inflation data and the continued speculation on China may limit near-term dollar buying, but this should be viewed as a pause in the dollar rally rather than the start of a reversal,"" said Derek Halpenny, senior currency economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. 42431999"

Rumours persist in the media that the company is attracting interest from private equity groups. Despite a 2.7 per cent rise in group sales to GBP5.47bn, pre-tax profits fell to GBP481m in the year to March 31 from GBP543.5m the year before, as the company invested GBP200m in cutting prices under the ""lower prices you'll love"" programme. The high street chemist shocked the market in March with a surprise profits warning which resulted in the subsequent departure of finance director, Howard Dodd. The slide in profits comes as UK retail sales figures for the three months to April rose unexpectedly by 0.2 per cent. However, the growth came from stores where food sales dominate. Sales at predominantly non-food stores fell by 0.2 per cent. Overall gross margins at Boots fell 80 basis points. Lower prices and promotional programmes caused a 260 basis point reduction in margins which the group said was offset by new products and manufacturing efficiency. The company expects gross margins to remain broadly stable. Net debt increased by GBP445m to GBP594m. Despite the decline in profits, Thursday's annual results were slightly ahead of the company's restated forecast of GBP465m to GBP475m. ""Boots the chemists has been through a huge amount of change this year as we have delivered our plans to make Boots a more competitive and efficient retailer,"" said Richard Baker, chief executive. ""None of this has been easy but despite a competitive environment and a slowdown in spending across the high street the early signs have been encouraging,"" he added. Analysts were split as to whether the deterioration in Boots' trading performance made it a candidate for acquisition. Matthew McEachran at Investec said: ""Boots is a strong takeover candidate, given completion of most of the investment, potential efficiencies yet to flow, reduced market credibility and absence of [a finance director]."" However, Numis Securities thought otherwise, saying analysts thought a private equity bid for the group was unlikely at a premium to the current share price.

Seperately, Superdrug, the UK's second largest health and beauty chain which is owned by the AS Watson group, turned up the heat on its rival as it announced plans to spend GBP75m on expanding in the UK, saying that it sees the potential for over 1000 stores in the UK, up from the current figure of just under 700. 42431801"

The high street chemist revealed in March that it was struggling to reap the benefits of its turnaround strategy with a surprise profit warning. The slide in profits comes ahead of UK retail sales figures for April. On Wednesday J Sainsbury reported its biggest fall in profits in its 135-year history and Next said sales had slumped in the first fifteen weeks of the year. The overall gross margin fell 80 basis points. Lower prices and promotional programmes caused a 260 basis point reduction in margins which the group said was offset by the introduction of new products and manufacturing efficiency. The company expects gross margins to remain broadly stable in the near future, although costs are expected to increase by 6 per cent as the company invests in infrastructure and new space. Net debt increased by GBP445m to GBP594m. Boots said that the proceeds of the sale and leaseback of 300 stores expected to be completed over the summer would be used to pay down short-term debt.

Richard Baker, chief executive, said a ""significant proportion"" of the proceeds from the sale of Boots International Healthcare, which manufactures and markets products, such as Clearasil, would be returned to shareholders. They have received GBP1.7bn through share buy-backs and dividends in the past three years. Shareholders broadly welcomed the news. They were less impressed with Mr Baker's latest profits warning, which he blamed on a poor trading environment. He also said costs would come in higher than analysts' expectations. Underlying sales growth, ahead by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, would fall back to 0 to 2 per cent this year, against projections of 3 to 4 per cent. He also warned he expected Boots' difficulties to continue through Christmas 2005. ""We have made a lot of progress but it is really tough right now. Nobody enjoys a profits warning. It is difficult for me and difficult for shareholders,"" said Mr Baker, as analysts cut forecasts for 2005-06 from about GBP480m to between GBP430m and GBP440m. A year ago, Boots the Chemist was expected to make GBP600m for the year. It is now expected to make less next year than the current financial year. The retailer is on track to make GBP475m in 2004-05. The downgrades will put further pressure on Mr Baker, who is 18 months into his effort to change Boots into a credible competitor on the high street by cutting prices to maintain customers while also trying to hold margins. Gross margins have fallen 80 basis points in 2004-05, while costs - linked to IT updates and store openings - are expected to rise 6 to 7 per cent in 2005-06. ""I think the real issue here is continuing sales and margin squeeze,"" said one top ten shareholder. ""It seems partly self-inflicted. They do appear to be spending money at a more rapid pace than you would have anticipated. Richard has a little more time to run but not much more. You have got to wonder if there is a bit of a credibility issue beginning to open up."" Boots also confirmed it was carrying out a GBP250m sale and leaseback on 300 smaller stores. The move, revealed in the Financial Times, is being handled by Cushman Wakefield Healey Baker, the property agents. Additional reporting by Jim Pickard 41642260"

Once a household name, it disappeared in 1968, bought by Boots. Tears might be shed if Boots itself went the same way, but the UK chemist's survival is not written in stone. Indeed, it looks ever rockier. Considering the doldrums in which the retail sector is languishing, first-half trading figures were not disastrous. But a 1.3 per cent fall in underlying sales is simply not good enough. Costs are rising by at least 6 per cent, driven not just by the same pressures facing the rest of the industry (wages, property rates, oil), but by a reinvestment programme on which Boots is pinning its recovery hopes. Guidance for full-year sales growth of 0-2 per cent was left unchanged, but seems increasingly unachievable, meaning an inevitable further decline in gross margin. Richard Baker, chief executive, argues he is less than halfway into a five-year plan to transform Boots into the pre-eminent UK health and beauty retailer. But the unforgiving public markets may be unwilling to give him that long. Boots and other troubled companies - Marks and Spencer springs to mind - might be happier out of the limelight, in the private equity sphere, where owners may have more realistic expectations of how long a turnround takes. But, for the moment at least, it remains in the public eye. The stock has been supported by generous payouts to shareholders, which will continue with the sale of Boots Healthcare International. But the BHI sale will significantly reduce free cash flow and thus dividend cash cover. Moreover, it will still leave Boots trading at or above the sector's 15 times 2005 price/earnings multiple.

Richard Baker, chief executive, added to the gloom by saying he would not reiterate the retailer's full-year sales guidance, adding that the market would have to make its own view. The retailer, which has put its over-the-counter medicines business up for sale following a string of profits warnings at its parent, said like-for-like sales at Boots the Chemists were expected to be down 1.3 per cent for the first half of the year as tough trading conditions continued. Boots said while its performances in health and beauty and toiletries was encouraging, other categories - including food, photo and electrical - saw sales declines. Mr Baker said: ""Trading conditions have been difficult throughout the first half with consumer spending softening further over the last quarter and we see no sign that the market will get any easier for the rest of the year."" He said the the retailer would continue to work on managing its trading margin, costs and working capital. Mr Baker has previously said that the retailer's priority should be to reinvest in the business, refocus on core markets and re-establish Boots' position as a health and beauty expert. As part of its strategy of focusing on core its business, the retailer earlier this year decide to sell Boots Healthcare International (BHI). The over-the-counter business has struggled to cope with competition from supermarket chains and upmarket department stores able to offer more specialist advice to customers. BHI, which manufactures and sells products including Strepsils, the throat lozenges, is understood to have attracted interest from groups such as Reckitt Benckiser, GlaxoSmithKline and Germany's Bayer. Boots said on Thursday that the sale of BHI, which could fetch as much as GBP1.5bn to GBP1.6bn, was on track. Second quarter sales at the unit were expected to rise 9 per cent, the retailer said. Elsewhere, Boots said its optical business suffered as consumers delayed replacing glasses and contact lenses. Boots Retail International, however, continued to perform well with sales up 12 per cent. In early morning trade the shares were down 2 per cent at 615p. 44756519"

Clarke represents as an MP the Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe. And it is in Nottingham that hundreds of jobs will go if the two companies do merge and Boots moves its head office to London. Boots said this week that it would maintain a ""substantial operating presence"" in Nottingham, where the company has been for more than 150 years. It employs 7,000 staff directly but has created thousands more local jobs in catering and security. This is the sort of thing constituents see their MP about in search of lobbying clout. But Clarke has approved the proposed deal as an Alliance director. As her boss spoke at the Conservative conference on Tuesday, Clarke's busy PR woman said: ""It is not a good time.

Cannot afford that several-thousand-pound hand-beaded dress? Get the GBP500 leather bag instead - that way you can still live the designer dream and, well, isn't it so much more practical anyway? But in an era when accessories hold such purchasing power, it is interesting to note that just as the trend for handbags is towards roomy, squashy, practical styles, so it is for clothes. Take Fendi's new runaway success, the Spy bag - designed by Silvia Fendi, it follows the rules of the house's other iconic bag, the Baguette: soft and structured but without a hard inner frame. It is the same at Chloe with the Paddington bag, and it is the same with the clothes on the runway. Women these days want practicality but not at the expense of style and shape; and tailoring, but not at the expense of freedom of movement or femininity. So when Karl Lagerfeld, the creative force behind Fendi's ready-to-wear line, showed a softer side this season it spoke volumes. Simple sleeveless shirt-style tops came with lace ruffles down the front and met a full skirt with a hemline decorated with lace-effect stencilling. It was soft, sophisticated, and cinched to the body using a wide Perspex belt. Chiffon blouses with ruffled cap sleeves lent a gentleness to skirts that clung to hips with belt and buckle detailing, and tulip skirts continued the easy drapery. Even bags were practical and featured large front pockets - some no more than large buckle-fastened pockets on a chain. For evening, shift dresses were made of layers of chiffon cascading one on top of the other - cinched again with a patent belt - some trimmed with sprigs of fur along the hemline. There was a similar sense of structured softness at Versace. That Donatella Versace has been toning down the glitz is not news, but the confident woman she is now presenting on the runway is one that needs only to know her clothes are well tailored and sexy without being overtly provocative; bling is a thing of the past. Slim-leg trousers - even jeans - were teamed with soignee jersey tops, chiffon dresses were demure with long sleeves, below-the-knee hemlines, and ruched waistbands but still smouldered with a low V neckline. For day, all was shades of nude; for evening, midnight blue took over with a jersey dress sizzling with a midriffneedle-lace detailing and spices of orange chiffon blazing their own trail in loose-fitting tops. It was a lesson in the power of understatement, a merging of movement with structure. Roberto Cavalli kept up the va-va-voom of Italian fashion with a trip to spring/summer shop floors by way of Palm Springs. Fitted trousers suits may have verged on the territory of vixendom but they were softened with blouses replete with ruffles and jackets with bow detailing. When edges were not softened with a frill or a flowing train, then it was done with fabric choices - a gingham shorts suit, for instance - to add a girlish edge to the sexiness. At Miu Miu there was plenty of tailoring, movement and an ease to silhouettes. Even the most apparently tailored pieces such as puff-sleeved jackets merged into a loose back, and dresses that seemed sewn closely to the body turned out to be tied like a pinafore at the back. There was a feeling of innocence about the collection with its school uniform influences and deeply romantic Jane Austen overtones with cropped jackets and full sleeves. Cut-out sides onslip dresses conjured up a little 1960s fun as did apop art star print that adorned dresses and coats. Knitted dungarees worn over simple tops heralded a retro-athleticism. Puff sleeves were a constant reference and, at Sportmax, puff-sleeved blouses in muted tones of silvery blue seemed to billow around the body and were teamed with more tailored shorts, softened with bow-tied belts. The modern mix continued to include a cropped Regency khaki jacket worn over a floor-length, empire-line pink dress. Etro continued the blend of hard and soft, tailoredand loose. Blouses came in chiffon with miniature, multi-button fastenings for added delicacy. Wrap-over skirts with pink, white and black tile prints flowed as if in a summer breeze and were partnered with cropped waistcoats and pinstripe, silk, granddad shirts. Even trouser suits were softened in linen, and the house paisley lightened in pale yellow. There is still room for a touch of whimsy, and for this Moschino's Cheap and Chic range can be relied on. Tomato beads were sewn on jumpers; the colours of the Italian flag were paramount. But femininity was also on display with big bows, 1950s skirts emblazoned with large hearts, fun Perspex coats, and Wellington boots with heels and gingham turn-overs. It seems that every fashion edge these days can cope with a little softening. 44836802"

In a meeting room at the headquarters of Enel, the Italian electricity company, four men hammered out the basis of the marriage. Richard Baker, Boots chief executive, and his chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, sat on one side of the table, with Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem, and his chairman Paolo Scaroni - then also chief executive of Enel - on the other. The merger between the two companies - long ""dreamt"" of by Mr Pessina - was facilitated by the long-standing relationship between Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni. Sir Nigel hired the Italian as his chief executive at Pilkington in 1977. In 2004, Mr Scaroni had invited Mr Pessina and Sir Nigel to Italy with their wives for an informal get together. The pair, who knew each other well already, talked informally about a tie-up. But it was only when Mr Scaroni was appointed chairman of Alliance in February this year, that he set about building the foundations for a deal that will create ""Europe's leading pharmacy-led healthcare group"" with just under 2,700 pharmacies and a wholesale network servicing 88,000 chemists. The fruition of those talks was on Monday laid before investors and analysts at a carefully orchestrated press conference. Each of the four men who will lead the enlarged company - Sir Nigel, Mr Pessina, George Fairweather (group finance director) and Mr Baker - presented their part of the deal. Mr Scaroni, now chief executive of Eni, the Italian oil and gas company, was not at the meeting and will step down from the board to make way for his former boss. The enlarged group will have turnover of GBP13.8bn and operating profit - splitting off Boots Healthcare International, the Strepsils to Clearasil division - of GBP711m. It will have a distribution network across 11 markets and retail outlets in five markets. Cost savings will hit GBP100m over 4 years. The deal - subject to regulatory approval from the European Commission and the UK authorities - is set to be completed next year. It will give Boots 1,500 ""community pharmacies"" as it rolls out the Boots fascia across Alliance's chemist chain - formerly known as Moss - and 800 larger health and beauty stores. Mr Baker would not comment on what will happen to the 300-strong Boots opticians and Scholl chains, although they could well be sold. Boots and Alliance on Monday billed it as a merger of equals which made perfect sense. As Mr Baker put it: ""Alliance is our largest supplier and we are one of their biggest customers. By bringing the two together we will create a leading European retail pharmacy group, enhancing growth opportunities and cost savings."" Mr Baker said he was also targeting ""other growth synergies"" by distributing Boots' products - such as Soltan suncream and No 7 make-up - through Alliance's distribution chain starting with southern European countries. He declined to talk about volume uplifts. But questions remain. First, some retail analysts on Monday threw doubt on the virtues of Boots adding more stores to its UK chain. ""The last thing a company having problems should do is make an acquisition,"" said Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who said Boots should concentrate on sorting out its core business before leaping anywhere else. Then there is the question of how the business will be run, with Mr Baker in charge of day-to-day decisions, and Mr Pessina, deputy executive chairman and 15 per cent shareholder of the enlarged group, responsible for strategy and acquisitions. Mr Pessina said yesterday that he does not want to muscle in on Mr Baker. ""I don't have any intention to interfere with Richard Baker in the day-to-day management of the business."" Mr Baker meanwhile says he is delighted to have such mentors on his side as a young chief executive. Shareholders, many of whom have investments in both companies, said they would grill the two management teams this week over the long-term strategic rationale. But some were happy that the cost savings would allow Boots to boost profits over the next two to three years. But they also said that Mr Pessina's ambitious acquisition plans could put the dividend - the company is promising dividend cover of 2 to 2.5 times - under threat. Mr Pessina plans to take the company from a business that currently makes 25 per cent of profit overseas to 50 per cent of profits by 2010. He will need sizeable funds to do this, and may well use the GBP400m retained by Boots from the sale of BHI. Shareholders said in spite of the questions they had, a key reassuring element was the successful relationship that Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni have forged over their careers. It may just be the sweetener that they need. 44827073"

After all, it was the moment Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance, had dreamt of for nearly five years, having approached the previous management with his suggestion only to be rejected. ""I am really delighted to be here. I can tell you I have wanted this for a long time,"" said the Italian. ""We found the right people to discuss [it with]. We have not changed, Boots has changed and understands the possibilities of working together."" The 63-year-old silver-haired entrepreneur also said he would be staying on at the business ""for as long as I can dedicate enough driving force to the group"". And he will need that driving force if he intends to follow the ambitious acquisition programme he hinted at on Monday. As executive deputy chairman of the enlarged group, Mr Pessina will be in charge of integrating the businesses and finding further acquisitions in Europe. He says he wants Alliance UniChem to make half of its profit overseas by 2010. It makes just half of that outside the UK. And he says he will fund it from cashflow, pointing out that Alliance on its own has made ?1.5bn (GBP1bn) in acquisitions in the past seven years. But his power will also be driven by his shareholding, given that he will have a 15 per cent stake in the enlarged group. Mr Pessina made his name as a dealmaker in 1998 when the merged Alliance Sante, the company he founded in the 1970s, with UniChem in 1998, on a 32 per cent stake in the merged company and its strategy. Echoing comments he made when Alliance Sante merged with UniChem, Mr Pessina said he had no intention of selling off his stake in Boots, insisting that he was committed to the company. ""I am a long-term shareholder and I believe in this company and I still believe in Alliance UniChem and I believe this will be a success."" The low-profile billionaire - who, like Mr Baker, Boots chief executive, is a trained engineer - does not do interviews or talk about his personal life. But he will now be in the spotlight as he develops the strategy for one of the UK's best known brands.

The 'merger of equals' unveiled on Monday between Boots and Alliance UniChem has much to recommend it in strategic terms. It gives Boots more retail clout in the UK and growth potential outside its mature home market. It gives gives Alliance UniChem access to Boots' strong brand name, products and stronger retail and wholesale positions - provided the UK competition authorities do not block the deal. The Office of Fair Trading is bound to take a very close look at a merger in an area as politically delicate as pharmacies. But assuming it does go ahead, could this merger of equals fall prey to the weakness of so many others - a failure at the start to carve up executive positions so that there is a clear and unambiguous line of command? This can lead to nasty fallings-out some way down the road, affecting performance. The potential for problems is clear. Stefano Pessina, who built up Alliance UniChem through a series of mergers and acquisitions, will hold 15 per cent of the new company's shares, and will have the unusual role of executive deputy chairman. He will be responsible for integration, strategy and acquisitions. He already has a long pipeline of potential deals, and expects that by 2010 the group should make half of its profits outside the UK, compared with about 25 per cent now. Richard Baker, Boots' chief executive, will keep that title in the enlarged group and will be in charge of day-to-day operations - a very demanding task, given that he has a long way to go to complete the turnround of Boots' core retailing operation. Mr Pessina has a strong record in acquiring companies and integrating them - though nothing quite on this scale - so there is a lot to be said for his assuming this role. However, integration is bound to take him into Mr Baker's sphere, while strategy is a decision for the board rather than one man. It may work. Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Boots and the combined group, is a corporate bruiser who can bang heads together - though you do not lightly bang the head of a 15 per cent shareholder. And Mr Pessina was on Monday at pains to stress the importance of having the word Alliance in the new company's name, demonstrating a spirit of partnership. One can only hope it lives up to it. MFI's woes ""How far have we come in the last five years?"" asked MFI's annual report in a rhetorical flourish earlier this year, and then went on to enumerate ways in which the group had supposedly changed for the better. But when it comes to profitability, it is going backwards. Issuing another profits warning yesterday, thanks to a huge drop in sales in its UK retail division last month, MFI said a continuation of the trend would mean a small pre-tax loss for the year. And while not yet in breach of banking covenants, or in a cash crisis, it is talking to its lenders. Against this background it was inevitable that John Hancock, chief executive since 1999, would quit. While responsible for a turnround in the group's fortunes in his early years, he has latterly presided over too many disappointments, ranging from poor marketing to a botched supply chain system. Many of the UK retailing arm's problems may be due to a grim high street climate, but investors had little remaining faith in Mr Hancock's ability to provide solutions to the challenge. His successor, Matthew Ingle, offers some hope. He has led the expansion of the Howden Joinery builders' merchants business - MFI's star asset and still trading well, though it could be vulnerable to a consumer slowdown - and is said to be a more hands-on manager than his predecessor. He needs to be. The first requirement is a fundamental review of the UK retail business to slash costs and re-engineer the business model, which is particularly heavily operationally geared, thanks to home delivery. He should also cast a cold eye over some lossmaking foreign ventures. Some analysts would like Howden to be spun off, but Mr Ingle may conclude there are useful synergies between it and retail. And while the group's GBP160m after-tax FRS?17 pension fund deficit may deter private equity bidders for the whole, interest in Howden may provide some underpinning to the shares around the current level. Non-executives A paucity of available non-executive boardroom talent is pointed up in a survey by Deloitte's remuneration arm. Individuals are being put off by the risks, responsibilities and time involved. Companies are having to look further afield to recruit, including abroad. All this is producing a sharp rise in non-executives' fees, with median pay for non-executives in the largest FTSE companies now GBP66,500. That may seem a large figure, but alongside the fees charged by consultants, and the increased risks shouldered by board members, it is not - provided the non-executives add real value. Cue more performance measurement. martin.dickson@ft.com 44826604"

Mittal Europa As the European Union ruminates over the future status of Turkey, top steelmakers' attention will turn today to Ankara where a fight for control of the country's biggest steel producer will take place in a small conference room in the Hilton hotel. Four big steelmakers and two Turkish financial groups will be represented at the auction for control of Erdemir, which has annual capacity of 5m tonnes and is under Turkish state control. In the frame to bid for Erdemir as part of the shortlist whittled down from a much larger cast of would-be suitors are Mittal Steel and Arcelor, the world's two largest steel companies, plus Novolipetsk and Severstal of Russia. The bidding is expected to take about 30 minutes. Each contender will have only a few chances to raise its offer before the highest bidder wins. The auction will be televised to ensure fair play; the winner is expected to have to put up GBP1.1bn-GBP1.7bn to get a stake of just over 50 per cent. Lakshmi Mittal, chairman and owner of Mittal Steel, will send his instructions from London. By contrast Guy Dolle, chief executive of Luxembourg-based Arcelor, will camp in Ankara at a secret location to monitor the process, but not actually be in the room with the bidders. The Russians are keeping mum about their tactics but are rumoured to be willing to bet high to get the prize. Pardon the French French Connection Group's decision to reduce the profile of its FCUK brand won't stop Dennis Woodman's challenge to the trademark on taste grounds from proceeding tomorrow (Mudlark, September 27). Last week saw the publication of an appeal judgment in a similar case, upholding the Trade Marks Registrar's refusal to accept ""Fook"". Advertised on radio or asked for in a shop, it said, ""Fook"" could be indistinguishable from the out-of-bounds ""Fuck"". The judgment also revealed that the refusal to register ""Tiny Penis"" had previously been upheld on appeal, but ""Dick Fanny"" had been accepted. The appeal judgment in the latter case had noted, informatively, that ""Dick and Fanny are the diminutive forms of the English first names Richard and Frances (the latter being the feminine version of Francis) respectively"". French Connection isn't worried by Woodman's challenge. It only directly affects the trademark as it applies to watches. FCUK is also registered as a European trademark. Dutch treats While ABN Amro was sending out bottles of Cava to the UK press (Mudlark, October 1), staff in the Dutch bank's head office were being offered more modest hospitality of Italian ice cream and espresso - to celebrate winning control of Banca Antonveneta. It was part of the bank's global celebrations, which, whatever one thinks about the Italian regulatory and financial landscape, had a touch of self-righteousness. One bank employee was quoted: ""I feel proud to work for an organisation that ran its campaign on such ethical grounds, notwithstanding the environment and constraints it was working under. I come from India and the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, used to say, 'truth prevails'."" And proportion? Snatched away Because it was Monday or because Mudlark is jaded, the latest issue of The Actuary magazine actually looked interesting. The curious cover line ""Alien abduction"" referred to a book on how to avoid that fate, not to a means of solving the pensions crisis. 44826603"

Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance, said the new combine would be acquisitive in the international markets. Executives from Alliance UniChem held a board meeting on Saturday afternoon to approve the deal. Their counterparts at Boots met to finalise details and give approval to the deal that was first reported by the Financial Times on Saturday. The market appears to share managements enthusiasm about the deal as in early trading, Boots shares rose 6.4 per cent to 647.5p while Alliance Unichem shares were up nearly 4 per cent at 900p. Under the terms of the merger, Boots will sell Boots Healthcare International, which makes products such as Strepsils and Clearasil, for GBP1.7bn-GBP1.8bn. The company will reinvest GBP400m of the net proceeds of the deal and will return the rest to its own shareholders. The remaining Boots business, including 1,400 health and beauty stores, will join Alliance UniChem in a nil premium merger, where neither set of shareholders will receive a premium over the market value of their shares. Alliance UniChem has 939 chemists across the UK and a wholesale pharmaceutical business across 12 European countries. ""I have been chasing this deal for five years,"" said Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance. ""The balance sheet has been structured for an acquisitive company and we will be accelerating our acquisition programme in all the big countries around the world except for the US."" ""Boots is Alliance Unichem's largest supplier and we know each other well,"" said Richard Baker, Boots chief executive. ""A lot of the ideas came from a strategic review but we started talking more formally in April."" ""There is a small amount of competition concern but we do not believe this merger will be anti-competitive. Boots is built mostly on retail locations, while Alliance is mostly community pharmacies,"" he added. A break-fee will be inserted into the merger terms. This would mean that Boots would be forced to pay its rival 1 per cent of the value of the deal if it chose to walk away or if another bidder made a counter-offer. The fee has been agreed in return for Mr Pessina who owns 32 per cent of Alliance, giving an irrevocable acceptance of the deal. Richard Baker will take the same role in the enlarged group, while Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, will chair it.

Justin King, of J?Sainsbury, positively puffs up when he is talking about his road to recovery and Stuart Rose delights in his profile as the man from Marks and Spencer. But Mr Baker has been doggedly dodging the spotlight since taking the helm at Boots 21 months ago. As the chief executive who faces one of the toughest challenges on the high street, it is hard to blame him. ""For a period of time it felt that every time you opened a newspaper, someone was having another pop,"" he says. ""It was frustrating because, actually, when I looked at what we have actually achieved, I was very proud."" The company suffered from a run of bad news in the spring: Roger Matthews its finance director, resigned suddenly and it was forced to issue two profit warnings over the course of just five weeks. Several analysts predicted Mr Baker's time would soon be up. Boots faces a number of challenges, some very much of its own making. But its main challenge is a competitive one. At one end of the market, it is under attack from the supermarkets, who are using their giant buying power to snatch market share in basic toiletries. Tesco's share of the UK toiletries market has been climbing and is now on par with Boots at 20 per cent while Boots' share has fallen from about 25 per cent over the past decade. At the higher end of the market, the department stores and specialist boutiques are better able to offer the personal advice that those buying more expensive products demand. ""This is not a badly broken business,"" says the former Asda executive. ""This is an extremely profitable company and it is not crashed and broken on the runway. We just made 10 per cent profit on sales, competing with the likes of Tesco and Asda, and that's after a GBP200m price investment and GBP140m of other investments."" Yet Boots is badly wounded after being run as a high-margin, high-profit business for over a decade. ""If you run a business for cash for a long time, in the end that cash cow comes to its knees - it's got nothing left in it."" So Mr Baker has thrown the old strategy into reverse, attempting to drive sales by bringing margins - and profit - down. He has cut prices on 3,000 items by almost a fifth. To support this, he is trying to cut costs by streamlining the supply chain and cutting more than 2,000 jobs. He has also replaced all the tills in his 1,400 stores with more modern ones that give better sales data. And he is selling off unprofitable business such as laser eye surgery and dentistry. Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter medicine manufacturer whose products include Strepsils throat lozenges and Nurofen pain killers, is also on the block. Mr Baker is determined to refocus Boots on its health and beauty business. To this end, it is relaunching the No.7 make-up range and putting more beauty halls in shops. But as the two profit warnings suggest, Boots is stumbling as it tries to find its way again. With its margins falling - Mr Baker says the operating margin will be about 9 per cent this year against 10.1 per cent last year - UBS, Boots' house broker, expects Boots to make GBP66m less this year than the GBP481m it made last year. Mr Baker says he has done a lot of work behind the scenes to sharpen up Boots' basic operating platform. ""To me, the next stage of the journey we've laid out is that we've got to drive our healthcare business and we've got to drive our beauty business. This is moving to the next stage, building a better base."" Mr Baker, however, is hampered by structural difficulties that are hangovers from Boots's past. These include an enormous store portfolio that does not fit his vision. The big stores, built in the 1970s when Boots was trying to be a department store, are too vast for his more streamlined vision of Boots as a health and beauty specialist. Mr Baker says he currently has no plans for a wholesale store closure programme but analysts regard this as an inevitable and necessary next step. For the time being, the surplus space means Mr Baker has to fill his stores with other products. He briefly considered selling sex toys but thinks such products as mobile phones and blenders and coffee makers are a better bet. Yet this sits uncomfortably with his vision of Boots as a health and beauty specialist. ""It's a practical thing in the end,"" he says. ""We've got some very big stores that, with health and beauty alone, would be over-spaced. If we didn't have the space, would we go into this merchandise? No, is the honest answer. But we've got the space and we need to trade it."" He also has to decide what to do with Boots' manufacturing arm, which makes own-brand product for Boots, such as the No.7 and Soltan ranges, as well as goods for BHI and other big consumer businesses. Mr Baker shifts in his chair when asked if Boots Manufacturing will be put on the auction block once BHI is sold this summer. ""I don't want to go anywhere near an answer,"" he says. ""I think we need to take one step at a time. By March, we'll know what's going on, we'll have completed the transaction of BHI [and] we'll then be in a position to assess exactly what happens."" Finally, Mr Baker has the issue of the sprawling site in Nottingham, which has over 100 buildings and seems far too big for Boots' needs. The head office alone is only half full following Mr Baker's job cull. Mr Baker insists that Boots will not move from Nottingham but acknowledges that redeveloping the site to generate income will be difficult. With all the problems he faces, it might make more sense for Mr Baker not to sell off Nurofen after all. 43169582"

The 'merger of equals' unveiled on Monday between Boots and Alliance UniChem has much to recommend it in strategic terms. It gives Boots more retail clout in the UK and growth potential outside its mature home market. It gives gives Alliance UniChem access to Boots' strong brand name, products and stronger retail and wholesale positions - provided the UK competition authorities do not block the deal. The Office of Fair Trading is bound to take a very close look at a merger in an area as politically delicate as pharmacies. But assuming it does go ahead, could this merger of equals fall prey to the weakness of so many others - a failure at the start to carve up executive positions so that there is a clear and unambiguous line of command? This can lead to nasty fallings-out some way down the road, affecting performance. The potential for problems is clear. Stefano Pessina, who built up Alliance UniChem through a series of mergers and acquisitions, will hold 15 per cent of the new company's shares, and will have the unusual role of executive deputy chairman. He will be responsible for integration, strategy and acquisitions. He already has a long pipeline of potential deals, and expects that by 2010 the group should make half of its profits outside the UK, compared with about 25 per cent now. Richard Baker, Boots' chief executive, will keep that title in the enlarged group and will be in charge of day-to-day operations - a very demanding task, given that he has a long way to go to complete the turnround of Boots' core retailing operation. Mr Pessina has a strong record in acquiring companies and integrating them - though nothing quite on this scale - so there is a lot to be said for his assuming this role. However, integration is bound to take him into Mr Baker's sphere, while strategy is a decision for the board rather than one man. It may work. Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Boots and the combined group, is a corporate bruiser who can bang heads together - though you do not lightly bang the head of a 15 per cent shareholder. And Mr Pessina was on Monday at pains to stress the importance of having the word Alliance in the new company's name, demonstrating a spirit of partnership. One can only hope it lives up to it. MFI's woes ""How far have we come in the last five years?"" asked MFI's annual report in a rhetorical flourish earlier this year, and then went on to enumerate ways in which the group had supposedly changed for the better. But when it comes to profitability, it is going backwards. Issuing another profits warning yesterday, thanks to a huge drop in sales in its UK retail division last month, MFI said a continuation of the trend would mean a small pre-tax loss for the year. And while not yet in breach of banking covenants, or in a cash crisis, it is talking to its lenders. Against this background it was inevitable that John Hancock, chief executive since 1999, would quit. While responsible for a turnround in the group's fortunes in his early years, he has latterly presided over too many disappointments, ranging from poor marketing to a botched supply chain system. Many of the UK retailing arm's problems may be due to a grim high street climate, but investors had little remaining faith in Mr Hancock's ability to provide solutions to the challenge. His successor, Matthew Ingle, offers some hope. He has led the expansion of the Howden Joinery builders' merchants business - MFI's star asset and still trading well, though it could be vulnerable to a consumer slowdown - and is said to be a more hands-on manager than his predecessor. He needs to be. The first requirement is a fundamental review of the UK retail business to slash costs and re-engineer the business model, which is particularly heavily operationally geared, thanks to home delivery. He should also cast a cold eye over some lossmaking foreign ventures. Some analysts would like Howden to be spun off, but Mr Ingle may conclude there are useful synergies between it and retail. And while the group's GBP160m after-tax FRS?17 pension fund deficit may deter private equity bidders for the whole, interest in Howden may provide some underpinning to the shares around the current level. Non-executives A paucity of available non-executive boardroom talent is pointed up in a survey by Deloitte's remuneration arm. Individuals are being put off by the risks, responsibilities and time involved. Companies are having to look further afield to recruit, including abroad. All this is producing a sharp rise in non-executives' fees, with median pay for non-executives in the largest FTSE companies now GBP66,500. That may seem a large figure, but alongside the fees charged by consultants, and the increased risks shouldered by board members, it is not - provided the non-executives add real value.

Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance, said the new combine would be acquisitive in the international markets. Executives from Alliance UniChem held a board meeting on Saturday afternoon to approve the deal. Their counterparts at Boots met to finalise details and give approval to the deal that was first reported by the Financial Times on Saturday. The market appears to share managements enthusiasm about the deal as in early trading, Boots shares rose 6.4 per cent to 647.5p while Alliance Unichem shares were up nearly 4 per cent at 900p. Under the terms of the merger, Boots will sell Boots Healthcare International, which makes products such as Strepsils and Clearasil, for GBP1.7bn-GBP1.8bn. The company will reinvest GBP400m of the net proceeds of the deal and will return the rest to its own shareholders. The remaining Boots business, including 1,400 health and beauty stores, will join Alliance UniChem in a nil premium merger, where neither set of shareholders will receive a premium over the market value of their shares. Alliance UniChem has 939 chemists across the UK and a wholesale pharmaceutical business across 12 European countries. ""I have been chasing this deal for five years,"" said Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance. ""The balance sheet has been structured for an acquisitive company and we will be accelerating our acquisition programme in all the big countries around the world except for the US."" ""Boots is Alliance Unichem's largest supplier and we know each other well,"" said Richard Baker, Boots chief executive. ""A lot of the ideas came from a strategic review but we started talking more formally in April."" ""There is a small amount of competition concern but we do not believe this merger will be anti-competitive. Boots is built mostly on retail locations, while Alliance is mostly community pharmacies,"" he added. A break-fee will be inserted into the merger terms. This would mean that Boots would be forced to pay its rival 1 per cent of the value of the deal if it chose to walk away or if another bidder made a counter-offer. The fee has been agreed in return for Mr Pessina who owns 32 per cent of Alliance, giving an irrevocable acceptance of the deal. Richard Baker will take the same role in the enlarged group, while Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, will chair it. George Fairweather, finance director of Alliance UniChem, will have the same role in the enlarged group. Mr Pessina will hold the deputy chairmanship in Alliance Boots and hold a 16 per cent stake, valued at about GBP1bn, in the new group. Jim Smart was on Monday appointed chief finance officer of Boots until the merger is completed next year. He has been acting CFO since May. Alliance Boots will have its main headquarters in London, although some retail operations will remain at Boots' 156-year-old headquarters in Nottingham. The two sides said they expected cost synergies of GBP100m over four years covering logistics, information technology, head office costs and purchasing. ""There's a lot of fat in Boots,"" one person close to the deal said. There are unlikely to be large store closures as both sides will argue that their retail chains serve different segments of the market.

In a meeting room at the headquarters of Enel, the Italian electricity company, four men hammered out the basis of the marriage. Richard Baker, Boots chief executive, and his chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, sat on one side of the table, with Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem, and his chairman Paolo Scaroni - then also chief executive of Enel - on the other. The merger between the two companies - long ""dreamt"" of by Mr Pessina - was facilitated by the long-standing relationship between Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni. Sir Nigel hired the Italian as his chief executive at Pilkington in 1977. In 2004, Mr Scaroni had invited Mr Pessina and Sir Nigel to Italy with their wives for an informal get together. The pair, who knew each other well already, talked informally about a tie-up. But it was only when Mr Scaroni was appointed chairman of Alliance in February this year, that he set about building the foundations for a deal that will create ""Europe's leading pharmacy-led healthcare group"" with just under 2,700 pharmacies and a wholesale network servicing 88,000 chemists. The fruition of those talks was on Monday laid before investors and analysts at a carefully orchestrated press conference. Each of the four men who will lead the enlarged company - Sir Nigel, Mr Pessina, George Fairweather (group finance director) and Mr Baker - presented their part of the deal. Mr Scaroni, now chief executive of Eni, the Italian oil and gas company, was not at the meeting and will step down from the board to make way for his former boss. The enlarged group will have turnover of GBP13.8bn and operating profit - splitting off Boots Healthcare International, the Strepsils to Clearasil division - of GBP711m. It will have a distribution network across 11 markets and retail outlets in five markets. Cost savings will hit GBP100m over 4 years. The deal - subject to regulatory approval from the European Commission and the UK authorities - is set to be completed next year. It will give Boots 1,500 ""community pharmacies"" as it rolls out the Boots fascia across Alliance's chemist chain - formerly known as Moss - and 800 larger health and beauty stores. Mr Baker would not comment on what will happen to the 300-strong Boots opticians and Scholl chains, although they could well be sold. Boots and Alliance on Monday billed it as a merger of equals which made perfect sense. As Mr Baker put it: ""Alliance is our largest supplier and we are one of their biggest customers. By bringing the two together we will create a leading European retail pharmacy group, enhancing growth opportunities and cost savings."" Mr Baker said he was also targeting ""other growth synergies"" by distributing Boots' products - such as Soltan suncream and No 7 make-up - through Alliance's distribution chain starting with southern European countries. He declined to talk about volume uplifts. But questions remain. First, some retail analysts on Monday threw doubt on the virtues of Boots adding more stores to its UK chain. ""The last thing a company having problems should do is make an acquisition,"" said Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who said Boots should concentrate on sorting out its core business before leaping anywhere else. Then there is the question of how the business will be run, with Mr Baker in charge of day-to-day decisions, and Mr Pessina, deputy executive chairman and 15 per cent shareholder of the enlarged group, responsible for strategy and acquisitions. Mr Pessina said yesterday that he does not want to muscle in on Mr Baker. ""I don't have any intention to interfere with Richard Baker in the day-to-day management of the business."" Mr Baker meanwhile says he is delighted to have such mentors on his side as a young chief executive. Shareholders, many of whom have investments in both companies, said they would grill the two management teams this week over the long-term strategic rationale. But some were happy that the cost savings would allow Boots to boost profits over the next two to three years. But they also said that Mr Pessina's ambitious acquisition plans could put the dividend - the company is promising dividend cover of 2 to 2.5 times - under threat. Mr Pessina plans to take the company from a business that currently makes 25 per cent of profit overseas to 50 per cent of profits by 2010. He will need sizeable funds to do this, and may well use the GBP400m retained by Boots from the sale of BHI. Shareholders said in spite of the questions they had, a key reassuring element was the successful relationship that Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni have forged over their careers. It may just be the sweetener that they need. 44827073"

Recent market speculation suggested Hutchison which is controlled by Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest tycoon was monitoring the situation and considering whether to try to break up the deal, which will create a UK chain of nearly 2,400 Boots stores. Hutchison declined to comment on Thursday. However, it is understood the group one of the world's largest health and beauty retailers with more than 6,800 shops in 33 countries is not looking to increase its presence in the UK's health retail sector. It already owns more than 700 Superdrug stores in the UK and this year bought Merchant Retail, a perfumery retailer with outlets in the UK, Ireland and Australia. Insiders at Boots this week cast doubt over a Hutchison intervention, arguing that a bid was unlikely given the competition issues that would arise. However, Alliance Boots as the enlarged group will be called could itself face competition concerns. It is thought the company privately believes it may be forced to sell up to 200 stores. Meanwhile, just two bidders, of the original six were left last night in the race to buy Boots Healthcare International, which makes over-the-counter drugs including Nurofen painkillers and Strepsils throat lozenges and is valued at up to GBP1.8bn. Reckitt Benckiser, the household and personal care group that makes Lemsip and Disprin cold-relief products, is understood to be the likely winner, followed by Novartis of Switzerland. GlaxoSmithKline and Germany's Bayer dropped out on Thursday. Insiders said a deal could be announced today or Monday. Most of the proceeds will be returned to Boots' shareholders as part of its merger with Alliance, although the new group plans to keep GBP400m from the BHI disposal which it may well spend on acquisitions. Boots declined to comment on the sale last night Its management has been meeting shareholders over the past few days seeking to allay concerns over the deal's structure. Investors are thought to be concerned about the management arrangements given that Stefano Pessina, Alliance's executive deputy chairman and a 15 per cent shareholder in the enlarged company, will take responsibility for strategy and acquisitions normally a chief executive's job.

Given he likes cigars, Clarke could put business Boots' way by attending its smoking cessation clinic. But there is a more serious potential conflict. Clarke represents as an MP the Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe. And it is in Nottingham that hundreds of jobs will go if the two companies do merge and Boots moves its head office to London. Boots said this week that it would maintain a ""substantial operating presence"" in Nottingham, where the company has been for more than 150 years. It employs 7,000 staff directly but has created thousands more local jobs in catering and security. This is the sort of thing constituents see their MP about in search of lobbying clout. But Clarke has approved the proposed deal as an Alliance director. As her boss spoke at the Conservative conference on Tuesday, Clarke's busy PR woman said: ""It is not a good time.

Cannot afford that several-thousand-pound hand-beaded dress? Get the GBP500 leather bag instead - that way you can still live the designer dream and, well, isn't it so much more practical anyway? But in an era when accessories hold such purchasing power, it is interesting to note that just as the trend for handbags is towards roomy, squashy, practical styles, so it is for clothes. Take Fendi's new runaway success, the Spy bag - designed by Silvia Fendi, it follows the rules of the house's other iconic bag, the Baguette: soft and structured but without a hard inner frame. It is the same at Chloe with the Paddington bag, and it is the same with the clothes on the runway. Women these days want practicality but not at the expense of style and shape; and tailoring, but not at the expense of freedom of movement or femininity. So when Karl Lagerfeld, the creative force behind Fendi's ready-to-wear line, showed a softer side this season it spoke volumes. Simple sleeveless shirt-style tops came with lace ruffles down the front and met a full skirt with a hemline decorated with lace-effect stencilling. It was soft, sophisticated, and cinched to the body using a wide Perspex belt. Chiffon blouses with ruffled cap sleeves lent a gentleness to skirts that clung to hips with belt and buckle detailing, and tulip skirts continued the easy drapery. Even bags were practical and featured large front pockets - some no more than large buckle-fastened pockets on a chain. For evening, shift dresses were made of layers of chiffon cascading one on top of the other - cinched again with a patent belt - some trimmed with sprigs of fur along the hemline. There was a similar sense of structured softness at Versace. That Donatella Versace has been toning down the glitz is not news, but the confident woman she is now presenting on the runway is one that needs only to know her clothes are well tailored and sexy without being overtly provocative; bling is a thing of the past. Slim-leg trousers - even jeans - were teamed with soignee jersey tops, chiffon dresses were demure with long sleeves, below-the-knee hemlines, and ruched waistbands but still smouldered with a low V neckline. For day, all was shades of nude; for evening, midnight blue took over with a jersey dress sizzling with a midriffneedle-lace detailing and spices of orange chiffon blazing their own trail in loose-fitting tops. It was a lesson in the power of understatement, a merging of movement with structure. Roberto Cavalli kept up the va-va-voom of Italian fashion with a trip to spring/summer shop floors by way of Palm Springs. Fitted trousers suits may have verged on the territory of vixendom but they were softened with blouses replete with ruffles and jackets with bow detailing. When edges were not softened with a frill or a flowing train, then it was done with fabric choices - a gingham shorts suit, for instance - to add a girlish edge to the sexiness. At Miu Miu there was plenty of tailoring, movement and an ease to silhouettes. Even the most apparently tailored pieces such as puff-sleeved jackets merged into a loose back, and dresses that seemed sewn closely to the body turned out to be tied like a pinafore at the back. There was a feeling of innocence about the collection with its school uniform influences and deeply romantic Jane Austen overtones with cropped jackets and full sleeves. Cut-out sides onslip dresses conjured up a little 1960s fun as did apop art star print that adorned dresses and coats. Knitted dungarees worn over simple tops heralded a retro-athleticism. Puff sleeves were a constant reference and, at Sportmax, puff-sleeved blouses in muted tones of silvery blue seemed to billow around the body and were teamed with more tailored shorts, softened with bow-tied belts. The modern mix continued to include a cropped Regency khaki jacket worn over a floor-length, empire-line pink dress. Etro continued the blend of hard and soft, tailoredand loose. Blouses came in chiffon with miniature, multi-button fastenings for added delicacy. Wrap-over skirts with pink, white and black tile prints flowed as if in a summer breeze and were partnered with cropped waistcoats and pinstripe, silk, granddad shirts. Even trouser suits were softened in linen, and the house paisley lightened in pale yellow. There is still room for a touch of whimsy, and for this Moschino's Cheap and Chic range can be relied on. Tomato beads were sewn on jumpers; the colours of the Italian flag were paramount. But femininity was also on display with big bows, 1950s skirts emblazoned with large hearts, fun Perspex coats, and Wellington boots with heels and gingham turn-overs. It seems that every fashion edge these days can cope with a little softening. 44836802"

""We reserve judgment. At this point, we would prefer clarification on the long-term strategic merits of putting these two businesses together,"" said Martin Cobb, Templeton's investment manager. Citigroup analysts wrote: ""We fear that this deal has serious executional, managerial and possibly even regulatory risks. It is not the combination of two highly successful, high-return entities."" However, State Street Global Advisors, another large Boots shareholder, said the merger would help Boots for the next few years, given the GBP100m of cost savings promised on Monday. But it said the retailer still hadlonger-term strategic issues to deal with. Boots shares rose 24lp, or 4 per cent, to 633p, which some analysts put down to counterbid speculation. However, a jump in Boots' corporate bonds suggested investors believe a leverage buy-out is unlikely. Alliance's shares rose 8.5p to 875p.

Boots' second largest shareholder, Templeton, which owns more than 5 per cent of the chemist chain and also has a stake in Alliance UniChem, said it remained to be convinced of the deal's benefits. ""We reserve judgment. At this point, we would prefer clarification on the long-term strategic merits of putting these two businesses together,"" said Martin Cobb, Templeton's investment manager. Citigroup analysts wrote: ""We fear that this deal has serious executional, managerial and possibly even regulatory risks. It is not the combination of two highly successful, high-return entities."" However, State Street Global Advisors, another large Boots shareholder, said the merger would help Boots for the next few years, given the GBP100m of cost savings promised on Monday. But it said the retailer still hadlonger-term strategic issues to deal with. Boots shares rose 24lp, or 4 per cent, to 633p, which some analysts put down to counterbid speculation. However, a jump in Boots' corporate bonds suggested investors believe a leverage buy-out is unlikely. Alliance's shares rose 8.5p to 875p. Boots shareholders will have 50.2 per cent of the enlarged group's shares.

In a meeting room at the headquarters of Enel, the Italian electricity company, four men hammered out the basis of the marriage. Richard Baker, Boots chief executive, and his chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, sat on one side of the table, with Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem, and his chairman Paolo Scaroni - then also chief executive of Enel - on the other. The merger between the two companies - long ""dreamt"" of by Mr Pessina - was facilitated by the long-standing relationship between Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni. Sir Nigel hired the Italian as his chief executive at Pilkington in 1977. In 2004, Mr Scaroni had invited Mr Pessina and Sir Nigel to Italy with their wives for an informal get together. The pair, who knew each other well already, talked informally about a tie-up. But it was only when Mr Scaroni was appointed chairman of Alliance in February this year, that he set about building the foundations for a deal that will create ""Europe's leading pharmacy-led healthcare group"" with just under 2,700 pharmacies and a wholesale network servicing 88,000 chemists. The fruition of those talks was on Monday laid before investors and analysts at a carefully orchestrated press conference. Each of the four men who will lead the enlarged company - Sir Nigel, Mr Pessina, George Fairweather (group finance director) and Mr Baker - presented their part of the deal. Mr Scaroni, now chief executive of Eni, the Italian oil and gas company, was not at the meeting and will step down from the board to make way for his former boss. The enlarged group will have turnover of GBP13.8bn and operating profit - splitting off Boots Healthcare International, the Strepsils to Clearasil division - of GBP711m. It will have a distribution network across 11 markets and retail outlets in five markets. Cost savings will hit GBP100m over 4 years. The deal - subject to regulatory approval from the European Commission and the UK authorities - is set to be completed next year. It will give Boots 1,500 ""community pharmacies"" as it rolls out the Boots fascia across Alliance's chemist chain - formerly known as Moss - and 800 larger health and beauty stores. Mr Baker would not comment on what will happen to the 300-strong Boots opticians and Scholl chains, although they could well be sold. Boots and Alliance on Monday billed it as a merger of equals which made perfect sense. As Mr Baker put it: ""Alliance is our largest supplier and we are one of their biggest customers. By bringing the two together we will create a leading European retail pharmacy group, enhancing growth opportunities and cost savings."" Mr Baker said he was also targeting ""other growth synergies"" by distributing Boots' products - such as Soltan suncream and No 7 make-up - through Alliance's distribution chain starting with southern European countries. He declined to talk about volume uplifts. But questions remain. First, some retail analysts on Monday threw doubt on the virtues of Boots adding more stores to its UK chain. ""The last thing a company having problems should do is make an acquisition,"" said Philip Dorgan, analyst at Panmure Gordon, who said Boots should concentrate on sorting out its core business before leaping anywhere else. Then there is the question of how the business will be run, with Mr Baker in charge of day-to-day decisions, and Mr Pessina, deputy executive chairman and 15 per cent shareholder of the enlarged group, responsible for strategy and acquisitions. Mr Pessina said yesterday that he does not want to muscle in on Mr Baker. ""I don't have any intention to interfere with Richard Baker in the day-to-day management of the business."" Mr Baker meanwhile says he is delighted to have such mentors on his side as a young chief executive. Shareholders, many of whom have investments in both companies, said they would grill the two management teams this week over the long-term strategic rationale. But some were happy that the cost savings would allow Boots to boost profits over the next two to three years. But they also said that Mr Pessina's ambitious acquisition plans could put the dividend - the company is promising dividend cover of 2 to 2.5 times - under threat. Mr Pessina plans to take the company from a business that currently makes 25 per cent of profit overseas to 50 per cent of profits by 2010. He will need sizeable funds to do this, and may well use the GBP400m retained by Boots from the sale of BHI. Shareholders said in spite of the questions they had, a key reassuring element was the successful relationship that Sir Nigel and Mr Scaroni have forged over their careers. It may just be the sweetener that they need. 44827073"

After all, it was the moment Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance, had dreamt of for nearly five years, having approached the previous management with his suggestion only to be rejected. ""I am really delighted to be here. I can tell you I have wanted this for a long time,"" said the Italian. ""We found the right people to discuss [it with]. We have not changed, Boots has changed and understands the possibilities of working together."" The 63-year-old silver-haired entrepreneur also said he would be staying on at the business ""for as long as I can dedicate enough driving force to the group"". And he will need that driving force if he intends to follow the ambitious acquisition programme he hinted at on Monday. As executive deputy chairman of the enlarged group, Mr Pessina will be in charge of integrating the businesses and finding further acquisitions in Europe. He says he wants Alliance UniChem to make half of its profit overseas by 2010. It makes just half of that outside the UK. And he says he will fund it from cashflow, pointing out that Alliance on its own has made ?1.5bn (GBP1bn) in acquisitions in the past seven years. But his power will also be driven by his shareholding, given that he will have a 15 per cent stake in the enlarged group. Mr Pessina made his name as a dealmaker in 1998 when the merged Alliance Sante, the company he founded in the 1970s, with UniChem in 1998, on a 32 per cent stake in the merged company and its strategy. Echoing comments he made when Alliance Sante merged with UniChem, Mr Pessina said he had no intention of selling off his stake in Boots, insisting that he was committed to the company. ""I am a long-term shareholder and I believe in this company and I still believe in Alliance UniChem and I believe this will be a success."" The low-profile billionaire - who, like Mr Baker, Boots chief executive, is a trained engineer - does not do interviews or talk about his personal life. But he will now be in the spotlight as he develops the strategy for one of the UK's best known brands. On Monday, in spite of being a man keen to be out of the spotlight, he seemed to enjoy it - just this once. 44826998"

The 'merger of equals' unveiled on Monday between Boots and Alliance UniChem has much to recommend it in strategic terms. It gives Boots more retail clout in the UK and growth potential outside its mature home market. It gives gives Alliance UniChem access to Boots' strong brand name, products and stronger retail and wholesale positions - provided the UK competition authorities do not block the deal. The Office of Fair Trading is bound to take a very close look at a merger in an area as politically delicate as pharmacies. But assuming it does go ahead, could this merger of equals fall prey to the weakness of so many others - a failure at the start to carve up executive positions so that there is a clear and unambiguous line of command? This can lead to nasty fallings-out some way down the road, affecting performance. The potential for problems is clear. Stefano Pessina, who built up Alliance UniChem through a series of mergers and acquisitions, will hold 15 per cent of the new company's shares, and will have the unusual role of executive deputy chairman. He will be responsible for integration, strategy and acquisitions. He already has a long pipeline of potential deals, and expects that by 2010 the group should make half of its profits outside the UK, compared with about 25 per cent now. Richard Baker, Boots' chief executive, will keep that title in the enlarged group and will be in charge of day-to-day operations - a very demanding task, given that he has a long way to go to complete the turnround of Boots' core retailing operation. Mr Pessina has a strong record in acquiring companies and integrating them - though nothing quite on this scale - so there is a lot to be said for his assuming this role. However, integration is bound to take him into Mr Baker's sphere, while strategy is a decision for the board rather than one man. It may work. Sir Nigel Rudd, the chairman of Boots and the combined group, is a corporate bruiser who can bang heads together - though you do not lightly bang the head of a 15 per cent shareholder. And Mr Pessina was on Monday at pains to stress the importance of having the word Alliance in the new company's name, demonstrating a spirit of partnership. One can only hope it lives up to it. MFI's woes ""How far have we come in the last five years?"" asked MFI's annual report in a rhetorical flourish earlier this year, and then went on to enumerate ways in which the group had supposedly changed for the better. But when it comes to profitability, it is going backwards. Issuing another profits warning yesterday, thanks to a huge drop in sales in its UK retail division last month, MFI said a continuation of the trend would mean a small pre-tax loss for the year. And while not yet in breach of banking covenants, or in a cash crisis, it is talking to its lenders. Against this background it was inevitable that John Hancock, chief executive since 1999, would quit. While responsible for a turnround in the group's fortunes in his early years, he has latterly presided over too many disappointments, ranging from poor marketing to a botched supply chain system. Many of the UK retailing arm's problems may be due to a grim high street climate, but investors had little remaining faith in Mr Hancock's ability to provide solutions to the challenge. His successor, Matthew Ingle, offers some hope. He has led the expansion of the Howden Joinery builders' merchants business - MFI's star asset and still trading well, though it could be vulnerable to a consumer slowdown - and is said to be a more hands-on manager than his predecessor. He needs to be. The first requirement is a fundamental review of the UK retail business to slash costs and re-engineer the business model, which is particularly heavily operationally geared, thanks to home delivery. He should also cast a cold eye over some lossmaking foreign ventures. Some analysts would like Howden to be spun off, but Mr Ingle may conclude there are useful synergies between it and retail. And while the group's GBP160m after-tax FRS?17 pension fund deficit may deter private equity bidders for the whole, interest in Howden may provide some underpinning to the shares around the current level. Non-executives A paucity of available non-executive boardroom talent is pointed up in a survey by Deloitte's remuneration arm. Individuals are being put off by the risks, responsibilities and time involved. Companies are having to look further afield to recruit, including abroad. All this is producing a sharp rise in non-executives' fees, with median pay for non-executives in the largest FTSE companies now GBP66,500. That may seem a large figure, but alongside the fees charged by consultants, and the increased risks shouldered by board members, it is not - provided the non-executives add real value. Cue more performance measurement. martin.dickson@ft.com 44826604"

Mittal Europa As the European Union ruminates over the future status of Turkey, top steelmakers' attention will turn today to Ankara where a fight for control of the country's biggest steel producer will take place in a small conference room in the Hilton hotel. Four big steelmakers and two Turkish financial groups will be represented at the auction for control of Erdemir, which has annual capacity of 5m tonnes and is under Turkish state control. In the frame to bid for Erdemir as part of the shortlist whittled down from a much larger cast of would-be suitors are Mittal Steel and Arcelor, the world's two largest steel companies, plus Novolipetsk and Severstal of Russia. The bidding is expected to take about 30 minutes. Each contender will have only a few chances to raise its offer before the highest bidder wins. The auction will be televised to ensure fair play; the winner is expected to have to put up GBP1.1bn-GBP1.7bn to get a stake of just over 50 per cent. Lakshmi Mittal, chairman and owner of Mittal Steel, will send his instructions from London. By contrast Guy Dolle, chief executive of Luxembourg-based Arcelor, will camp in Ankara at a secret location to monitor the process, but not actually be in the room with the bidders.

Pardon the French French Connection Group's decision to reduce the profile of its FCUK brand won't stop Dennis Woodman's challenge to the trademark on taste grounds from proceeding tomorrow (Mudlark, September 27). Last week saw the publication of an appeal judgment in a similar case, upholding the Trade Marks Registrar's refusal to accept ""Fook"". Advertised on radio or asked for in a shop, it said, ""Fook"" could be indistinguishable from the out-of-bounds ""Fuck"". The judgment also revealed that the refusal to register ""Tiny Penis"" had previously been upheld on appeal, but ""Dick Fanny"" had been accepted. The appeal judgment in the latter case had noted, informatively, that ""Dick and Fanny are the diminutive forms of the English first names Richard and Frances (the latter being the feminine version of Francis) respectively"". French Connection isn't worried by Woodman's challenge. It only directly affects the trademark as it applies to watches. FCUK is also registered as a European trademark.

One bank employee was quoted: ""I feel proud to work for an organisation that ran its campaign on such ethical grounds, notwithstanding the environment and constraints it was working under. I come from India and the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, used to say, 'truth prevails'."" And proportion?

Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance, said the new combine would be acquisitive in the international markets. Executives from Alliance UniChem held a board meeting on Saturday afternoon to approve the deal. Their counterparts at Boots met to finalise details and give approval to the deal that was first reported by the Financial Times on Saturday. The market appears to share managements enthusiasm about the deal as in early trading, Boots shares rose 6.4 per cent to 647.5p while Alliance Unichem shares were up nearly 4 per cent at 900p. Under the terms of the merger, Boots will sell Boots Healthcare International, which makes products such as Strepsils and Clearasil, for GBP1.7bn-GBP1.8bn. The company will reinvest GBP400m of the net proceeds of the deal and will return the rest to its own shareholders. The remaining Boots business, including 1,400 health and beauty stores, will join Alliance UniChem in a nil premium merger, where neither set of shareholders will receive a premium over the market value of their shares. Alliance UniChem has 939 chemists across the UK and a wholesale pharmaceutical business across 12 European countries. ""I have been chasing this deal for five years,"" said Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance. ""The balance sheet has been structured for an acquisitive company and we will be accelerating our acquisition programme in all the big countries around the world except for the US."" ""Boots is Alliance Unichem's largest supplier and we know each other well,"" said Richard Baker, Boots chief executive. ""A lot of the ideas came from a strategic review but we started talking more formally in April."" ""There is a small amount of competition concern but we do not believe this merger will be anti-competitive. Boots is built mostly on retail locations, while Alliance is mostly community pharmacies,"" he added. A break-fee will be inserted into the merger terms. This would mean that Boots would be forced to pay its rival 1 per cent of the value of the deal if it chose to walk away or if another bidder made a counter-offer. The fee has been agreed in return for Mr Pessina who owns 32 per cent of Alliance, giving an irrevocable acceptance of the deal. Richard Baker will take the same role in the enlarged group, while Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, will chair it. George Fairweather, finance director of Alliance UniChem, will have the same role in the enlarged group. Mr Pessina will hold the deputy chairmanship in Alliance Boots and hold a 16 per cent stake, valued at about GBP1bn, in the new group. Jim Smart was on Monday appointed chief finance officer of Boots until the merger is completed next year. He has been acting CFO since May. Alliance Boots will have its main headquarters in London, although some retail operations will remain at Boots' 156-year-old headquarters in Nottingham. The two sides said they expected cost synergies of GBP100m over four years covering logistics, information technology, head office costs and purchasing. ""There's a lot of fat in Boots,"" one person close to the deal said. There are unlikely to be large store closures as both sides will argue that their retail chains serve different segments of the market.

The peculiarity of the successive increases in US interest rates that began in June 2004 is that this has been so slow to happen. Earlier this year, when the rating agencies downgraded General Motors and Kirk Kerkorian bid for GM equity, there was a brief flurry in the markets as arbitrageurs in the credit derivatives market were squeezed. It promptly subsided. But now, spurred by the bankruptcy of GM supplier Delphi, which features in countless collateralised debt obligations, and with the troubles of futures broker Refco, something is again afoot. Credit spreads are widening, with emerging markets and junk bonds bearing the brunt. Is a financial storm brewing? The established wisdom is that risk is now being spread across a more diverse group of financial institutions than in the past and that the growth of credit derivatives permits more credit risk to be hedged. But not all members of the establishment subscribe fully to this view. In a recent paper, Raghuram Rajan, economic counsellor and director of research at the International Monetary Fund, accepts that institutional change and financial innovation brings big benefits.* Yethe argues that new non-bank outfits, such as hedge funds, have flawed incentives. In a competitive market, they feel compelled to take risks that are hidden from investors to generate higher returns than their peers. The kind of risks that can be most easily concealed, says Rajan, are those that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability ""tail"" risks but offer generous compensation the rest of the time. Managers also have an incentive to herd with other fund managers to reduce the risk of losing clients. This drives asset prices away from fundamental values. At the same time, banks that transfer credit risk to non-banks have been feeding non-bank risk appetites and becoming more dependent on liquidity in markets to hedge the resulting complex structured products. The risk, as we move away from a low-interest environment, is that, when a shock hits the markets, all those whizzy, highly leveraged hedge fund managers who have been writing the equivalent of disaster insurance in the credit markets are hit by margin calls at the same time. In Rajan's telling phrase, banks that have been forced by competition to flirt continuously with the limits of illiquidity will be less able to provide liquidity when it is needed. He concludes that the financial risks being created by the system are greater than in the past. This thesis neatly explains the stability since the Russian default in 1998 and leaves open the possibility of something nasty ahead. I think we are at the point in the credit cycle where we can feel what Lord Overstone, the 19th century bullionist, called ""a slight premonitory movement of the ground under our feet"". * Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier? IMF, August 2005. Given the size of the fiscal problems in Italy, Belgium and Greece, it seems astonishing that interest rates in the eurozone government bond market do not differentiate more between countries to reflect the risk of default. Earlier this year, when Italy's fiscal position took a turn for the worse and politicians started to talk openly about leaving the monetary union, they briefly did. The spread on the Italian government 10-year bond against the comparable German bond widened to more than 20 basis points. Yet it is now back below that level. And the reason is partly that the European Central Bank in its open market operations applies the same interest rate to all eurozone governments regardless, thereby ensuring that potentially wayward spreads obey a gravitational law. Now I hear that there has been lively debate in the ECB on whether it should start to differentiate. Yet for the ECB to pass judgment daily on the economic competence of European governments would be politically explosive. That does not mean that it will not happen. Charles Goodhart, of the London School of Economics, points out to me that, if the ECB differentiated mechanistically on the basis of independent credit ratings, the political problem would become manageable. Not an entirely happy thought for hard-pressed Italians. All credit to the trustees of the WH?Smith pension scheme for following Boots in shifting to a liability-driven investment policy, with the twist of using derivatives instead of bonds. It is worth pointing out that this is a great moment for sponsoring companies in retailing to gear up at corporate rather than pension fund level. With share prices down and borrowing costs low, a switch out of equities in the fund could be accompanied by borrowing on the corporate balance sheet to invest in buy-backs. For companies with borrowing capacity, it is a tax-efficient way of reducing the cost of capital while boosting earnings per share. 45051175"

That is certainly true for the insurance sector after this year's hurricane season.For existing insurers and reinsurers facing claims, estimates of costs are spiralling relentlessly upwards, with the total for the sector said to approach $80bn (GBP45bn).Yet for prospective entrants, the hurricane season has produced opportunities as increased demand leads to higher premium ratesand even more capacity.The latest evidence of this came on Tuesday with the debut on Aim of Lancashire Holdings, a Bermudan insurer and reinsurer that has an enterprise value of about $1bn. The move highlights some of the issues in the reinsurance sector as it comes to terms with a particularly destructive season.First there is the interest from hedge funds, attracted by the impressive rewards that can accompany the risks in reinsurance. Lancashire's backers include Moore Capital and SAB Capital.Second there is timing. Because the scale of the hurricane season became apparent only so late in the year, Lancashire looks like being one of the last new entrants able to be in business in time for January renewals. Part of Aim's appeal over New York seems to have been how quickly the company could come to the market.Then there is the business mix. While the initial opportunities are most evident in reinsurance and in retrocession (acting as the reinsurer's reinsurer), Lancashire intends that by the end of its first year of operation about 75 per cent of its gross written premiums should be in primary insurance with only the remainder in reinsurance. This will offer a less exciting risk-reward profile than other Bermudan reinsurers, but carries the benefit of requiring less capital than reinsurance alone.Lancashire's decision to spread its business is sensible. Though the prospect of reinsurance demand exceeding supply next year is undoubtedly attractive, the sector carries the risk not only of natural disasters but of overcapacity, forcing down the very rates that made it so popular. It will require discipline for the market not to go there. Ah, those dark satanic rumour mills. All sorts of market gossip is swirling around the proposed merger between Boots and Alliance UniChem, but it seems to have little basis in hard fact. The talk is of disappointing trading at Boots and downward pressure on the share price, which could force a re-opening of the terms of the transaction. Certainly, a disappointing Christmas would be unhelpful, but there is no clear evidence either way, and the Boots share price has been relatively resilient since the deal. Taking the undisturbed price - before bid talk began - it is down only 2 per cent, though against the sector it is down more than 7 per cent. Alliance UniChem is down far more in absolute terms - by 12 per cent - but its price relative to Boots, given the terms of the deal, has remained stable, adjusting for forthcoming dividend payments, including Boots' GBP1.4bn return of capital from the sale of its pharmaceuticals business. In other words, the market still seems to expect the deal to go ahead, though it may not be that keen on it. In any event, the odds now seem high that the deal will be referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission in late January or early February. The referral of the Waterstone's-Ottakar's deal would seem to raise the chances of the same happening here. That would put the deal into the deep freeze until the summer - by which time Boots and Alliance could inhabit a very different retailing world. No point getting too excited on the second leg of a marathon. Wanted - a new sponsor for the Whitbread book awards, now that Whitbread has decided to withdraw because consumers do not associate the prize with any of the company's products. So step forward Waterstone's, the bookseller? At first glance it might seem to make a lot of sense. Consumers would certainly associate the prize with its products - andthe company could do withsome positive publicity. Its takeover bid for Ottakar's, recently referred to the Competition Commission by a feeble Office of Fair Trading, tapped a deep vein of anti-Waterstone's venom among the literati, who complained about the supposed stranglehold of its central buying department. Handing out prizes might seem one way of ameliorating the hostility. Yet other book stores would hardly relish publicising the short lists and winners in a rival's competition - and that could get up the nose of authors, who are anyway not averse to biting the hand that feeds them. On second thoughts, it might be best to steer clear - and the same Catch 22 would appear to face any other company directly involved in the books business. And if, like Whitbread, your products are not associated with books, why get involved either? 46090965"

A deal that has attracted only lukewarm investor reaction and seemed destined to be referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission has been waved through by the OFT, subject to the sale of pharmacies in about 100 locations. The decision means the process should be shortened by six to eight months so that the deal could be completed in July. Initial analyst estimates are that the combined group might receive up to GBP100m from the sale of the pharmacies they must divest. Each company's share price closed at its highest point since the merger was announced in October. The only downside is for any investors who had cherished the somewhat forlorn hope that an extended and less certain process might tempt a private equity house to bid for Boots. There are still detailed negotiations to have about which stores must be sold. But the agreement in principle with the regulator should give the two companies greater freedom to spell out more clearly the benefits of the merger. In particular, giving more details about the annual pre-tax cost savings of GBP100m by the fourth full year after implementation, set out in the original announcement, would enable analysts to estimate better how much higher it might be. More broadly, John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, used the occasion of Tuesday's announcement to make it clear that the regulator still believes the retail pharmacy market would benefit from further liberalisation, beyond the limited measures the government agreed in 2003. Smaller pharmacy chains, already contemplating what should be a stronger combined Alliance Boots, will not relish the prospect of further liberalisation as well. A promise of greater transparency and disclosure is always welcome, especially from a company that has a rather unhappy history. So Martin Flanagan's first efforts in presenting annual results at Amvescap - he joined the asset management group as chief executive last summer - started well. But it was rather cheeky to trumpet a forecast of a $120m (GBP58m) reduction in operating expenses in 2006 without spelling out, until questioned by analysts on a conference call, that the savings would be from the 2005 base, which was particularly high because of $75.7m of restructuring charges that should not recur. It is also worth knowing that the savings will not necessarily fall through to profit. The share price, up 10 per cent on the announcement of the results on Tuesday, from 507lp to 558lp, fell back after the call to close at 534lp. When the recovery story is as long term as Amvescap's, Mr Flanagan needs to keep investors onside and he has clearly been working hard to meet and greet shareholders since he arrived. The net outflows of funds from the company seem to be slowing but it will take time for Amvescap to generate the superior investment performance that will attract investors back in hordes. Meanwhile, the plan to integrate the business so that, for instance, US retail investors can be offered Japanese equity products, will also take time to generate profit. But at least the slide in profit since 2000 has now been arrested and this year should see the recovery begin. That probably removes hopes of a bid, so the share price, which was down about 300p before last summer's bid approach, is unlikely to go much further without more good news. ""One leading shareholder pleased"" might sound like the headline to a pretty dull story. But in the context of HMV's swift rebuff to the 190p-a-share indicative cash offer from Permira, it is very interesting indeed. A classic tactic for a private equity house whose approach has been dismissed is to look to shareholder discontent to put pressure on the target board to agree their indicative bid as a basis for allowing due diligence to take place. So the move by an institutional investor, who did not wish to be named, to make clear it is happy with HMV's decision will not help Permira's plans. There is no mathematical formula for setting the level at which a target should agree to open the company up for due diligence. What it does need to take into account is the likely duration and disruption that process will involve. It must also be aware that its best hope of raising the level of an offer is before opening the books rather than once the potential bidder has had a chance to search for reasons to drop the price. Other investors may be less content. But any of them would find it hard not to agree that the challenges of finding a new chief executive and managing the books, music and DVD retailer through a structurally changing market is a task from which the HMV board should not be needlessly distracted. 47041355"

The Office of Fair Trading gave the go-ahead after receiving undertakings from both parties that they would dispose of stores in 100 areas where it was concerned that the merger would result in reduced competition. Boots shares rose 9lp to 684lp while Alliance Uni-Chem's rose 22lp to 882lp. The decision took some analysts by surprise. Eithne O'Leary, of Oriel Securities, said the OFT ruling was ""very much against the run of expectations"", adding that the requirement to dispose of 100 stores was a ""very minor"" undertaking. The merger will bring together Boots' 1,450 stores with its partner's 939, and will capture 19 per cent of the UK market with sales of more than GBP13bn. The two companies welcomed the decision, saying they would work closely with the OFT to agree on appropriate undertakings. Provided there are no appeals against the ruling, and that shareholders agree to accept the deal, the merger is set to be completed by mid-summer. The ruling was accompanied by a statement from John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, who said retail pharmacy was a market in which government regulations restricted competition by imposing barriers to new market entrants. Cost savings arising from the merger might not be passed on fully to consumers in the form of enhanced services, Mr Fingleton said. ""There remains a strong case for the government to reconsider the costs to consumers of maintaining these disproportionate restrictions on competition in the retail pharmacy sector,"" he said. Mr Fingleton later said the regulations cost consumers GBP50m each year but he believed constant reiteration of its concerns would eventually make the government lift restrictions. Competition from supermarkets has hit Boots' sales but Boots said it was an oversimplification to cite that threat as the main reason for the merger. ""The role of the chemist in healthcare is growing. The healthcare market has been growing by 6 per cent for the past 10 years and the government white paper says more needs to be done to bring healthcare to the community."" In the credit derivatives market, the cost of buying protection against a Boots default fell about 23.5 per cent, indicating that investors saw a lower likelihood of a counterbid from private equity companies emerging. The annual cost of buying credit default swaps to insure ?10m (GBP6.85m) of Boots bonds for five years fell from ?85,000 to ?65,000. Additional reporting by Ivar Simensen 47039710"

John Fingleton, chief executive of the Office for Fair Trading, said current regulations restrict competition by imposing barriers to new market reforms. These may prevent consumers benefiting from the merger, which will create a group that controls a fifth of dispensers in the UK. ""Cost savings arising from this merger may not be fully passed on to consumers in the form of enhanced services,"" he said. The OFT said it had identified 100 locations where Boots and Alliance Unichem must sell outlets to ensure competition for consumers. But Vincent Smith, the consumer watchdog's competition enforcement director, said ""Boots has offered divestment undertakings for all of these areas and the OFT is satisfied that these will address its concerns.""

Recent market speculation suggested Hutchison which is controlled by Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest tycoon was monitoring the situation and considering whether to try to break up the deal, which will create a UK chain of nearly 2,400 Boots stores. Hutchison declined to comment on Thursday. However, it is understood the group one of the world's largest health and beauty retailers with more than 6,800 shops in 33 countries is not looking to increase its presence in the UK's health retail sector. It already owns more than 700 Superdrug stores in the UK and this year bought Merchant Retail, a perfumery retailer with outlets in the UK, Ireland and Australia. Insiders at Boots this week cast doubt over a Hutchison intervention, arguing that a bid was unlikely given the competition issues that would arise. However, Alliance Boots as the enlarged group will be called could itself face competition concerns. It is thought the company privately believes it may be forced to sell up to 200 stores. Meanwhile, just two bidders, of the original six were left last night in the race to buy Boots Healthcare International, which makes over-the-counter drugs including Nurofen painkillers and Strepsils throat lozenges and is valued at up to GBP1.8bn. Reckitt Benckiser, the household and personal care group that makes Lemsip and Disprin cold-relief products, is understood to be the likely winner, followed by Novartis of Switzerland. GlaxoSmithKline and Germany's Bayer dropped out on Thursday. Insiders said a deal could be announced today or Monday. Most of the proceeds will be returned to Boots' shareholders as part of its merger with Alliance, although the new group plans to keep GBP400m from the BHI disposal which it may well spend on acquisitions. Boots declined to comment on the sale last night Its management has been meeting shareholders over the past few days seeking to allay concerns over the deal's structure. Investors are thought to be concerned about the management arrangements given that Stefano Pessina, Alliance's executive deputy chairman and a 15 per cent shareholder in the enlarged company, will take responsibility for strategy and acquisitions normally a chief executive's job. Boots shares closed unchanged on Thursday at 622p. Alliance UniChem fell 13p to 818p, having stood at 875.25p on Monday, when the merger was confirmed. 44887622"

The UK's largest pharmacy operator is challenging the Office of Fair Trading's decision last month to approve the creation of a pan-European pharmaceutical, health and beauty distribution and retail powerhouse. The main thrust of the pharmacy chain's appeal is aimed at forcing its rivals to dispose of additional stores. The OFT has already ordered the combined group to sell more than 100 retail outlets, thought to be worth GBP80m to GBP100m, as a condition of the merger. Lloyds Pharmacy is in a position to benefit from any disposals, as its German parent Celesio, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals retailer, is keen to expand in the UK. Celesio recently added 111 sites at a cost of more than GBP130m to the Lloyds chain, which includes 1,530 pharmacies. Celesio and Alliance UniChem are battling across Europe to expand into the retail sector in order to offset the threat to their traditional wholesale pharmaceutical businesses from government cuts in drug prices. Superdrug, the beauty and healthcare retailer, said yesterday it was interested in snapping up any pharmacies sold off by Boots or Alliance UniChem. Other likely buyers for the sites being sold by the group are thought to include the Co-operative Group, private equity buyers and regional operators. Lloyds said its grounds for appeal centred on the regulator's conclusion about the merger's impact on the local pharmacy market, which it claims was ""inadequately reasoned"" and based on a simple store count. Justin Ash, managing director of the pharmacy chain, said the regulator did not probe deeply enough into the growing role of pharmacies in providing healthcare services to communities. LLoyds' appeal argues that ""defects in the OFT's assessment of the local retail market also vitiate the OFT's conclusions that no competitive concerns arise at a national level."" Its submission to the Competition Appeals Tribunal states that: ""The undertakings proposed by the parties are insufficient and inappropriate to remedy the competitive concerns arising from the merger."" The appeal process could delay or even block the merger, but both Boots and Alliance UniChem insisted yesterday the deal was still on track. 47878286"

The company is switching to an automated warehouse system in a bid to centralise operations and cut costs. The proposal will see the creation of a GBP70m ($121m) centralised automated warehouse in Nottingham designed to supply its retail operations and the replacement of 17 existing regional warehouses with lorry docking facilities. Boots said the supply chain revamp will reduce stock holding, improve productivity and lower property costs and is expected to take three years to complete. Payback is expected within three years of completion. As part of the overhaul, the company is to invest in smaller stores. Some 700 of these will receive ""substantial investment"", including new facilities to take advantage of opportunities being created through changes in the healthcare market. ""This will position the stores to take advantage of the opportunities being created through the changing nature of the healthcare market,"" said Richard Baker, chief executive, referring to the white paper on improving community health and services. ""This is a major step forward in our plans to build a better Boots. The successful sale of BHI has allowed us to return GBP1.4bn to shareholders and accelerate our future plans."" Boots, which completed its sale of Boots Healthcare International at the end of January, is reinvesting a significant part of the proceeds from the GBP1.9bn sale in the overhaul of the business. Boots said current plans did not assume any sales benefit from the investment in the small stores. Changes to the supply chain and IT will remove around GBP60m of annual operating costs by 2010/2011, weighted towards the latter years. No savings were anticipated in 2006/7. The cash cost of the changes will be about GBP250m, with another GBP45m of asset write-offs. Capital investment will be around GBP120m, with the first GBP50m falling in 2006/7 and the remainder over the following three years. Revenue costs of about GBP90m and GBP45m of asset write-offs will be treated as exceptional in the current financial year, with no impact on trading profit. The remaining revenue costs of about GBP40m will also be treated as exceptional and will be charged over the following four years. ""These projects are independent of, but complementary to, the proposed merger with Alliance UniChem. The benefits of these changes are incremental to the GBP100m synergy benefits previously identified as resulting from the proposed merger,"" Boots said. The merger of Boots and Alliance UniChem was given the green light last month despite a new warning from the competition authorities about high barriers to entry facing potential rivals in the retail pharmacy sector. Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance UniChem, said earlier this month he was hopeful that the proposed GBP7bn merger between the pan-European drugs distributor and Boots would be completed by the end of June.

The companies are poised to sign a deal to put the Boots products - such as its Botanics skincare range and its No 7 cosmetics brand - into one-third of CVS's 6,100 stores. Boots, after some disastrous overseas ventures in Japan and Europe, has focused its US expansion on partnerships with existing retailers, choosing CVS and Target, the discount retailer that has built a reputation for ""cheap chic"" products and design.

He is certainly a robust character. But his credentials in maximising shareholder value when companies are sold in an auction are less clear cut. Alliance Boots has already rejected the proposed GBP9.7bn offer by KKR as too low. The private equity group may yet come back with a raised offer. Alternatively, while Alliance Boots' shares remain just below the proposed offer price, KKR may even go hostile. Sir Nigel's next task must be to form a committee of entirely independent members of Alliance Boots' board who can adjudicate on the value of any raised offer. That means excluding those who might have a financial interest in the company following any sale. He has already made the obvious exclusion of Stefano Pessina, the executive deputy chairman who owns 15 per cent of the stock and is leading the proposed buy-out in partnership with KKR.He has also excluded Mr Pessina's long-term partner, Ornella Barra. The snag is that Mr Pessina wants to rope in other members of the executive management. Depending on who Mr Pessina gets on board, Sir Nigel may be left with a committee entirely of non-executives. This would present two challenges. First, they would have a reduced ability to assess the value of the business because they are not involved in day-to-day management. Secondly, a number of the non-executives came from Alliance Unichem, which merged with Boots last year. Sir Nigel will have to ask himself whether they willbe accepted by shareholders as being genuinely inde-pendent. ""It was a clumsily constructed board in the first place, which makes it harder to manage this situation,"" says one banker. That said, Sir Nigel is no shrinking violet. He has a reputation for chomping through chief executives. He was on the board that showed the door to Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Barclays, in 1998. He also drove the replacement of Steve Russell, the former chief executive of Boots, with Richard Baker. ""He is a red meat-eating capitalist. Absolutely he's up to the job. His instincts are going to be right,"" says one leading City fund manager. ""You wouldn't want to argue against him in the boardroom,"" says another. The depth of Sir Nigel's deal-making skills will be tested, however. He may be a mergers and acquisitions veteran, but his experience of handling ""public-to-privates"" is limited. His experience rests largely on the sale of Pilkington, the glassmaker sold to Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass last year. There are some similarities with the Alliance Boots situation, in that NSG was already a large shareholder in the business, owning 20 per cent. Sir Nigel and the board rejected an initial 150p-a-share offer in November 2005 but then accepted a bid pitched at just 165p two months later. There was no auction. ""Has he gone through 15 public-to-privates before? No, he's not. But take-privates are especially difficult at the moment. We are all learning about them,"" says one veteran investment banker. ""He is as well-qualified a board practioner as there is. If I were a shareholder in Boots I couldn't think of anyone better for the challenge."" Stimulating an auction might be especially hard. Mr Pessina's link with KKR makes another private equity play tricky, while competition issues could deter others. Analysts say a tie-up with Celesio, the second-largest wholesale drugs distributor in Europe, would be near impossible on competition grounds. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies have reacted sceptically to suggestions that they might buy part or all of Alliance Boots. Some medicine groups have withdrawn entirely from non-prescription consumer products. Others - GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &Johnson - have been active in purchasing ""over-the-counter"" businesses in recent years. But that is of little use in this situation. Boots sold its medicine arm to Reckitt Benckiser in 2005. It is also hard to see why another private equity firm would weigh in. There is little freehold property to sell to help finance a deal. Alliance Boots' freehold stores could be worth about GBP1.5bn - double its net book value of GBP750m - according to RBC Capital Markets,the boutique headed byJohn Ralfe, a former Boots executive Against that backdrop, Sir Nigel might have to rely on shareholder support - possibly attracting a dogged hedge fund onto the register if he does not feel any future offer cuts the mustard.

The stark choice often faced by businessmen under investigation in the US could soon be a common sight over here if recommendations announced by the Attorney General are adopted. Much of his wide-ranging ""fraud review"" makes good sense. The seriousness of modern frauds - both as crimes against real victims and crimes against the financial system at large - justifies tough sentencing. But if judges are going to receive a heavier book to throw at miscreants it is imperative that more is done to ensure the safety of convictions. Much of the review's conclusions seem more focused on the convenience of the court system. This is understandable. There is not much point in tougher sentencing guidelines if cases are so long and complex that they bring the system to its knees rather than the defendant. It makes sense therefore to learn from foreign systems more adept at nailing complex white-collar prosecutions. Despite recent British concerns over extradition law, the US, in particular, has much to offer. Prosecutors such as Eliot Spitzer have shone light in dark corners that are rarely exposed in the UK. The use of plea-bargaining though is a dual-edged sword which should be handled carefully. At its best, it allows prosecutors to avoid the expense and risk of a trial while giving defendants some certainty that if they go quietly it will result in a lighter sentence. At its worst, however, the system is open to abuse by over-zealous prosecutors who use the threat of a harsh sentence to persuade middle managers to testify against their boss. While this may be appropriate when unravelling organised crime rings, it can have a chilling effect on mainstream business - not least because it is not always the case that those at the top are the most guilty. Threatened with a decade or more in prison, it is hard to imagine many employees who would not be tempted to shop their boss - guilty or not. Yet if white-collar crime is to be treated as harshly as other crimes, it is vital that the same principles of natural justice are granted in return. Given the review's call for specialist courts and the government's existing moves to allow judges to sit without juries in complex fraud cases, there is a real danger of the pendulum swinging too far the other way. A Boots tonic for NHS When it is so hard to persuade the Treasury that children's suncream can count as essential prophylactic, the sight of NHS managers being allowed to set up clinics at their local chemist is a rare outbreak of common sense. Despite the view among some Labour backbenchers that the aims of commerce can never be consistent with the hippocratic oath, Boots has already shown the beneficial power of business in keeping people away from hospital as long as possible. Its ""Change One Thing"" marketing campaign, for example, tapped into the good intentions after New Year to boost sales of nicotine treatments by 23 per cent. Drop-in testing centres for embarrassing conditions such as chlamydia have also helped teenagers avoid the trauma of a visit to their family medical centre. Now Boots in Poole has agreed with the local primary care trust to act as a host for outpatient services such as podiatry and blood tests. At its heart, the relationship is little more than that of landlord and tenant. But the PCT gains cut-price space in convenient high street locations and Boots gets a steady stream of customers in search of corn plasters and the like. It is such a win-win idea, it is hard to think why it has not taken off before. Even the fragmented and myopic US healthcare system has tested similar drop-in centres with retailers. The logical next step is to overcome remaining ideological myopia here and start using the national negotiating clout of the NHS to secure better terms than individual PCTs. Tarting up B&Q stores The argument that the ailing DIY sector should be pitied as a canary in the economic coal mine always looked a little shaky while the housing market stayed so strong. Now that Kingfisher has woken up to deeper structural challenges in the industry and decided to revamp 110 of its biggest stores it is time for a more honest reflection on its challenges. Kingfisher's Gerry Murphy has the right idea in providing services and more aspirational room displays as well as just nuts and bolts, but if the nation really is weaning itself off the DIY habit, it will take a lot more than this to restore the glory days for B&Q. A more prosperous generation seems to be developing a taste for letting someone else do it, especially if they are charging Polish labour rates. While there will always be those without the money to do this, even a small shift suggests the B&Q revamp will need to be much more comprehensive than the superficial paint job preferred by some of its traditional customers. dan.roberts@ft.com To comment, visit 50353776"

While the two FTSE 100 retailers were using the opportunity to paint their performances in the best possible light, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Stefano Pessina, executive deputy chairman of Alliance Boots, were fine-tuning an improvement to their GBP9.7bn offer, which was rejected by the pharmacy group's board earlier this month. Meanwhile, the CVC-led consortium circling Sainsbury was wrestling with the supermarket group's large pension deficit, which remains a potent obstacle to a firm offer. Alliance Boots' trading update - long at seven pages and more reminiscent of a defence document - contained plenty of optimistic talk and detailed a rise in fourth-quarter sales, 300 job cuts and a GBP65m rebranding exercise. Richard Baker, chief executive, insisted it was not a disguised defence document. ""I think it says 'trading statement' at the top and that's a very good way of describing it,"" he said. Analysts were, in any case, unimpressed by the 1.6 per cent increase in underlying UK retail sales and the fact that debt of ""slightly lower than"" GBP1.2bn was higher than consensus forecasts. KKR and Mr Pessina are understood to believe that the update strengthens their hand, supporting their contention that there is no hidden value in the company. Nonetheless, the team is expected to increase its GBP10-a-share indicative offer in the next few days. Mr Baker tried to ease concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the boardroom, saying: ""Stefano remains a director of the company [responsible for] corporate strategy and mergers and acquisitions?.?.?.?He continues to fulfil his responsibilities but has no involvement in any matter connected with the approach."" Refusing to answer more questions on his fellow director, he said: ""I'm on a strictly lawyered quote."" Richard Ratner, analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: ""We believe that the bidders will come back at somewhere around GBP10.40 and then it is likely that Boots management will roll over gracefully."" Unlike Alliance Boots, Sainsbury beat the most optimistic forecasts of like-for-like sales growth with a 5.9 per cent increase. Justin King, chief executive, boasted that he had achieved ""growth on growth on growth"" as he led the supermarket group through a recovery. He said he was keeping staff informed: ""If people know what's going on in an open and honest way as soon as they can, then that removes most of the worry."" In fact, more than a quarter of Sainsbury staff have profited from the takeover speculation. Mr King said more than 40,000 of the 150,000 staff had shares or options in the company. In a Merrill Lynch research note entitled ""Great trading ... now back to the pension"", John Kershaw said that although the pension deficit would be the consortium's greatest concern, the improved trading - which could add GBP15m to pre-tax profit - helped justify a bid as high as 600p. Shares in Sainsbury rose 1p on Thursday to 552p. Alliance Boots shares fell 8p to GBP10.13. Additional reporting by Lina Saigol and Elizabeth Rigby 55143750"

Celesio, the German pharmacy group, has hired NM Rothschild to sound out private equity firms to trump the approach of Stefano Pessina and KKR, his private equity backer. The German company, which owns the Lloydspharmacy chain in the UK, is in the early stages of trying to form a rival consortium that would try to top KKR's indicative GBP10.40-a-share offer and then split up Boots and share its assets. Although Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, agreed last Friday to allow KKR and Mr Pessina to carry out due diligence - and the board has indicated it would approve a firm offer at GBP10.40 a share - he would also open the books to any other serious bidder. Meanwhile, Boots' pension trustees have commissioned an ""emergency valuation"" of its pension fund, underscoring the prospect that the scheme could stand in the way of a deal as it has in the other potential private equity acquisition of a FTSE 100 retailer - the CVC-led consortium's approach for J?Sainsbury, the supermarket chain. Trustees to the Boots pension scheme, suspecting the company could be the target of a highly leveraged bid, developed an action plan several months ago. On the day the company was approached last month, trustees and their advisers assembled at Boots' Nottingham headquarters. They are understood to have commissioned an emergency valuation to bring the scheme's assumptions up to date with variables such as the improving life expectancy of members. Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Friday said there could be a GBP2bn ""black hole"" in the Boots pension scheme. ""Since 2004 pension fund trustees have had wide-ranging powers,"" the research note warned. ""Their sole obligation is to protect members' interests. They have no obligations to shareholders and do not need to negotiate."" But KKR and Mr Pessina are understood to believe both obstacles will be surmounted. The Boots pension scheme is widely believed to be well-funded; it was one of the first to replace much of its equity assets with bonds. Mr Pessina, who is Boots' largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, has ruled out working with a rival to KKR and has indicated he will likely walk away from the company if unsuccessful in his bid to take it private. 55214211"

Coles shares were up 5.3 per cent at A$16.97 at 11:05 Sydney time, valuing the group at A$20.3bn. Wesfarmers shares were up 4.9 per cent at A$38.72. The offer marks a dramatic twist in the long-running battle for the Australian supermarket and discount store group that was much criticised for rejecting a rival A$18.2bn private equity bid from a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led consortium late last year. Under the surprise proposal, Wesfarmers would take outright control of Coles' office supplies subsidiary and the Target discount store chain as well as 50 per cent of its core supermarket and Kmart Australia division. The core food and beverage business would be part-owned with Macquarie, the Sydney-based investment house, and Pacific Equity Partners and Permira, two private equity partners. Macquarie is also advising the consortium. While Wesfarmers - whose interests span financial services, chemicals and energy, as well as retailing - had been widely tipped as a possible buyer for the office supplies business, and possibly also Kmart, few had anticipated its interest in most of the group. Its market capitalisation stood at about A$14bn on Tuesday. ""There is a real opportunity to enhance these significant Australian businesses,"" Richard Goyder, Wesfarmers managing director, said. ""We believe a change of ownership will provide a catalyst for an improvement in performance."" The indicative bid has been pitched at A$16.47 a share, a price that analysts said was likely to fall within the range acceptable to shareholders. It was also the price paid in a raid on Coles' shares orchestrated by Macquarie on Wesfarmer's behalf after the market closed on Monday. While the raid fell short of its target of about 15 per cent, it yielded an 11.3 per cent holding, enough to complicate approaches by others. However, KKR, the leader of the consortium whose A$15.25 a share offer for Coles was rebuffed last year, said on Tuesday it was still interested in the retailer. The KKR consortium - which also includes Carlyle Group, CVC Asia Pacific and Texas Pacific Group - had been waiting for Coles to begin the formal due diligence process this month. But Coles, which put itself up for sale last month following a profits warning, said it would begin talks with Wesfarmers with a view to accelerating the due diligence process. "" Wesfarmers has described its proposal as non-binding, indicative, incomplete and as expressing its current intentions only,"" Rick Allert, Coles chairman, said. The Wesfarmers consortium will acquire about half of its holding from Solomon Lew, the former Coles chairman whose private investment company confirmed on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell its stake of almost 6 per cent at A$16.47 a share. 55267193"

The surprise move marks a new twist in one of Australia's biggest-ever takeover battles, sweeping aside attempts by Coles' board to control the sale process. The group put itself up for sale last month after rejecting an A$18.2bn bid by a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts last year. Wesfarmers said its bid is backed by Macquarie Bank, Permira and Pacific Equity Partners, a local private equity group. If its bid is successful, Wesfarmers said it would take full control of Officeworks, Coles' stationary and office equipment retail unit, and its Target Australia discount store chain and retain a 50 per cent interest in Coles' supermarkets and Kmart Australia while its financial partners take over the other half. Wesfarmers' existing holdings include Bunnings, the country's largest home improvement retail chain. Wesfarmers is offering Coles shareholders A$16.47 per share in cash or a custom mix of cash and Wesfarmers stock. Coles shares were suspended Tuesday but closed Monday at A$16.11. The bid preempts the KKR syndicate that has been pursuing Coles since last year. The KKR consortium, which at one point included nine groups, bid A$15.25 a share late last year. It was rebuffed after management decided instead to pursue its own restructuring plan. This was abandoned last month after shareholder pressure and a profits warning. Until Monday night, the Coles board had been expecting to auction the company, with a data room for prospective bidders expected to open in the next fortnight. It had invited bids either for the group as a whole or for each of its three main divisions. ""We believe that a change of ownership will provide a catalyst for an improvement in performance,"" said Richard Goyder, managing director of Wesfarmers. ""[Our proposal] is capable of implementation on a significantly accelerated timetable relative to other options for the sale of the company."" Rick Allert, chairman of Coles, said the two companies would discuss a timetable for Wesfarmers to conduct due diligence. "" Wesfarmers' proposal for the whole of the company reinforces our view that we have a set of unique and very valuable businesses in the Coles Group,"" he said. ""The level of interest in these assets remains high and we are committed to maximising value for our shareholders by continuing to run a competitive process."" KKR had indicated its continuing interest. Several of its former allies have been expected to join it again after the Coles' board failed in its attempt to significantly restrict the number of bidders allowed in a consortium. Tesco, the UK group, had also been mentioned as a potential bidder for Coles' supermarket business although some analysts have questioned the interest of European groups in a relatively small and distant market such as Australia's.

The surprise move marks a new twist in one of Australia's biggest-ever takeover battles, sweeping aside attempts by Coles' board to control the sale process. The group put itself up for sale last month after rejecting an A$18.2bn private equity bid last year. Wesfarmers said it was pursuing immediate discussions with Coles and its shares were suspended on request. It declined to comment further. It is believed to be working in conjunction with Macquarie Bank, the acquisitive investment bank that conducted the share raid, as well as with private equity partners. If confirmed, the consortium would rival the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led syndicate that has been pursuing Coles retailer since last year. The KKR consortium, which at one point included nine groups, bid A$15.25 a share for Coles late last year in what would have been by far Australia's biggest private equity takeover. It was rebuffed after management decided instead to pursue its own restructuring plan. This was abandoned last month after shareholder pressure and a profits warning. Analysts said Wesfarmers was most likely to be interested in Officeworks, Coles' stationary and office equipment retailer and possibly also Kmart Australia which would have synergies with Bunnings, the Perth group's home improvement chain. Solomon Lew's private investment company confirmed it had agreed to sell its stake of almost 6 per cent in Coles at A$16.47 a share. Mr Lew, a high profile business leader and former Coles chairman, has been one of the group's most vocal critics in recent years. Until Monday night, the Coles board had been expecting to auction the company, with a data room for prospective bidders expected to open in the next fortnight. It had invited bids either for the group as a whole or for each of its three main divisions. The acquisition of an 11.3 per cent stake, though short of the 15 per cent interest apparently sought, gives Wesfarmers and its partners a significant head start over other potential acquirers. KKR has indicated its continuing interest. Several of its former allies are expected to join it again after the Coles' board failed in its attempt to significantly restrict the number of bidders allowed in a consortium. As well as Officeworks and Kmart, Coles owns Australia's number two supermarket chain and the Target Australia discount store chain.

Since late February, the Texas power company has been searching for bidders willing to pay more than the $45bn, including debt, offered by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group. The most credible candidate for such a move was a team composed of Blackstone, Carlyle and Hellman &Friedman, which had hired bankers at Merrill Lynch and lawyers at Skadden Arps to advise them and had spent days studying TXU's confidential financial information. But TXU on Monday threw cold water on the chances that a counterbid would emerge before April 16, when the 50-day period during which the seller is open to rival offers ends. TXU, advised by Lazard, said it had signed confidentiality agreements with nine bidders but ""there is no indication that any of the parties is preparing a proposal that will be superior from either a price or transaction certainty perspective"". TXU shares were down 0.2 per cent at $63.90 by the close. KKR and TPG are offering $69.25 a share in cash for the company. One theory about why the Blackstone group decided not to move forward with a counterbid was that its plans for an initial public offering meant it was less inclined to enter a bidding war against two of its top rivals. Another theory was that political opposition encountered by KKR and TPG in Texas was deterring the competing team. ""Go-shop"" periods, in which a company selling to a private equity buyer is allowed to solicit other offers, have become standard practice. But they are controversial, as they rarely lead to competing offers, leading many to believe they are smokescreens for managements selling too easily or toorapidly. One notable exception recently was the case of Triad Hospitals, which was acquired by a consortium of private equity buyers early this year but then found a new buyer in Community Health in March. Although it advised investors not to expect any rival offer, TXU said it remained ""open"" to further approaches that may arise. 55243749"

Celesio's strange courtship Until the weekend, you would have put Celesio of Germany and Britain's Alliance Boots - each of which owns drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies - on opposite sides in most battles. The German company is among several challenging a deal struck by Pfizer to use Alliance Boots as its sole drug distribution company in Britain. Last year, it appealed, unsuccessfully, against Alliance Unichem's merger with Boots, arguing that the UK antitrust authorities had misread the local market, where Celesio owns more than 1,500 ""community"" pharmacies. Yet now, Celesio is trying to find a financial partner to bid for Alliance Boots and trump the offer being put together by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm. It is, to say the least, an unorthodox courtship. The timing of the Celesio approach has an opportunistic logic. Having just opened Alliance Boots' books to KKR, the target's board is ready to recommend a deal at a generous price of GBP10.40 a share. The presence of another potential bidder could slow down the process. But it is hard to discern a strategy through the tactics. If Celesio found a partner to outbid KKR, it could add some of Alliance Boots' 1,500 community pharmacies to its Lloyds Pharmacy chain. This could be the last chance for Celesio to unwind last year's deal. But continued ownership by Celesio of the wholesale arm would surely be off-limits on competition grounds - Celesio, Alliance Boots and Phoenix, another German company, dominate the European market. What is more, KKR's ally Stefano Pessina, the wholesaling brains behind the Alliance Unichem/Boots merger, has made clear that he will not throw in his lot - and his 15 per cent stake - with another bidder. Alliance Boots' board is duty-bound to look at any sensible offer - and it would be good for other shareholders if somebody were to challenge Mr Pessina's stance. But, as the immobility of Alliance Boots' share price yesterday suggests, Celesio has a long way to go to convince the directors that it is serious enough to be given access to the accounts. andrew.hill@ft.com 55243045"

A year ago Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' $29bn buy-out of First Data Corporation would have caused shockwaves for its sheer size. Now it is a ripple in the wave of private equity transactions that has swept the public markets. In fact, far more noteworthy than the headline numbers of the deal is the number of bankers involved. KKR managed to stitch up most of Wall Street with seven banks advising and helping to finance the transaction. That should make the idea of a counter-bid even less likely than usual. Most of the banks are, after all, committing equity as well as debt. The deal raises the question of whether we are entering a new buy-out phase. Historically a non-real estate transaction of that size, with an equity cheque of about $7bn, would have almost certainly required a ""club deal"" between different private equity houses. That meant the associated problems of nobody having full control and regulators getting worried about reduced competition among bidders. This structure avoids the first problem. It is hardly KKR and the seven dwarves - given the size of the banks involved - but the buy-out shop will have firm control of the deal. Whether it gets around concerns over competitive tension is not so clear. There is a risk that tying up too many banks creates a similar effect to private equity teaming up. But, for now, the banks are falling over themselves for more exposure to private equity investing. This structure gives them the chance to do that while avoiding direct competition with clients like KKR. Expect more of the buy-out shops to shun club deals in favour of full control - where they write the anchor cheque and the investment banks step up to provide the rest of the equity. 55239883"

For someone who normally prefers to avoid the public limelight, that may seem a bit strange. But then the French corporate raider at the head of a 6bn diverse family industrial empire probably never expected such stiff opposition from the Aegis management and board. All the more so given that UK law gives far greater power to shareholders to influence company boards than similar rules in the US and other European countries. Simply put, UK shareholders can call extraordinary meetings with 10 per cent of the voting share capital and put forward propositions to remove any and all directors if more than 50 per cent of votes cast favour the resolution. With such a large stake in Aegis, it should have been a simple formality for Mr Bollore to secure his two new board seats. Not so - and the French businessman has thus had to resort to the classic tactics of activist shareholders by making as much noise as possible in continental Europe to try to put pressure on other shareholders as well as win public and political support to force change. The irony is that Mr Bollore seems to have had a far easier ride in Italy, a country notorious for its board-friendly system propped up by big shareholding blocs and crony networks to frustrate activists and other minority shareholders. The affable Frenchman readily admits that when his group decides to invest in a company ""people get a bit scared"". This was the case in Italy seven years ago when he took a stake in Mediobanca, the Milan investment bank at the heart of Italian big business. Yet over the years, Mr Bollore claims, attitudes to his group have changed as it has shown to be a ""good long-term partner"" for Mediobanca and its main asset, Assicurazioni Generali. He says he is also investing in the long term with Aegis. He will repeat this message tomorrow at a shareholders meeting where he will again ask for two seats on the UK company's board. He argues his demands are perfectly reasonable. He says he is not seeking creeping control as the Aegis board has claimed, but an opportunity to discuss and participate in the life of the company as any shareholder with 29.1 per cent should be able to do. Mr Bollore has already tried twice and failed to get his way at Aegis. If, as expected, he fails again this week, he will simply keep trying until his message finally seeps through. He intends to keep calling three shareholders meetings a year to press his case because two would seem ""lazy"" and four ""excessive"". He also says he intends to be around until 2022 when his family company will celebrate its bicentennial. ""You know, our raison d'etre is not just to get into Aegis. We have many other interests and activities. But we are also very patient and ultimately I think we will make ourselves understood by Aegis and its other shareholders."" That is bound to mean making much more noise and a stream of fresh newspaper interviews.

Not yet free Carphone Warehouse investors, such as its new broadband customers, must learn to have patience. To bears, Monday's trading statement was a profit warning - unexpected and unwelcome - loading an additional GBP20m-GBP30m of costs on to the year to March 2008. To bulls, these costs are further necessary investments in promising areas, such as broadband and the joint ventures in the US and France. More detailed clues to the underlying performance - such as progress in integrating AOL's UK internet access business - will only be revealed to analysts later this month. Take the additional cost of broadband customer service. Overwhelmed by the success of its ""free"" Talk Talk offer last year, Carphone had to do some hasty hiring in order to cope with the demand. Charles Dunstone, the Carphone chief executive, employed his most winning manner on a blog in order to placate customers as they waited in line. His last posting was just before Christmas - which may or may not be a sign that things are getting better. On Monday, he told analysts: ""We've dragged ourselves up to the same bad level as the rest of the industry."" Half of the additional group costs for this financial year will pay for maintaining these additional staff, while the number of customers catches up and the number of complaints falls. Of course, if either measure moves in the other direction, those extra costs will persist. More positively, Carphone has managed to accelerate the migration of customers to ""unbundled"" lines. A bundled customer costs Carphone Warehouse GBP5 a month - mainly paid to BT for the privilege of using its exchanges - while an unbundled one generates GBP7 in profit. Although that trend was welcomed, some analysts trimmed their profit forecasts. Carphone Warehouse now trades on a multiple of 13 or 14 times prospective earnings for 2008. The 24 per cent decline in the share price since last October makes that seem fair. Wrist management Private equity's hold on British boardrooms goes beyond companies that are facing potential buy-outs, such as Alliance Boots or J Sainsbury. Most directors must have asked themselves in the past 12 months how they could apply some of private equity's techniques to their business.

A purchase of First Data by KKR would extend the wave of large takeovers by the world's largest private equity groups thanks to the availability of cheap debt to finance these deals. Ever since First Data spun off its Western Union money transfer division last year, it has been rumoured as a potential buy-out candidate because of its stable cashflow and its digestible size. Based in Colorado, First Data operates at the intersection of the financial services and technology industries, helping 1,900 card issuers process debit and credit card transactions. KKR, one of the oldest US private equity firms, has been on a frenzied buying spree in recent months. In February, it teamed up with TPG, a rival, to acquire TXU, the Texas-based energy group, for $45bn including debt. If that deal is approved by regulators and shareholders, it could rank as the largest buy-out on record. In March, KKR also agreed to buy Dollar General, a discount retailer, for $7bn. In Europe, KKR is pursuing an acquisition of Alliance Boots, the large drug store chain. KKR is offering to pay First Data shareholders more than a 20 per cent premium over the company's closing share price of $26.90 on Friday. In the current private equity boom, many critics contend that companies are selling out too easily to buy-out groups because of the lucrative incentives that are being offered to executives.

The German company is among several challenging a deal struck by Pfizer to use Alliance Boots as its sole drug distribution company in Britain. Last year, it appealed, unsuccessfully, against Alliance UniChem's merger with Boots, arguing that the Office of Fair Trading had misread the local market, where Celesio owns more than 1,500 ""community"" chemists under the Lloyds Pharmacy fascia. Yet now Celesio is trying to find a financial partner to woo Alliance Boots and trump the offer being put together by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm. It is, to say the least, an unorthodox courtship. The timing of the Celesio approach has an opportunistic logic. Having just opened Alliance Boots' books to KKR, the target's board is ready to recommend a deal at a generous price of GBP10.40 a share. The presence of another potential bidder could slow down the process and make shareholders think twice. But it is hard to discern a strategy through the tactics. If Celesio were to find a partner to outbid KKR, it could end up with some of Alliance Boots' 1,500 community chemist shops to add to its Lloyds Pharmacy chain. Only last week, Richard Baker, Alliance Boots' chief executive, heralded the roll-out of Boots branding across the old Alliance UniChem pharmacies. This could be the last chance for Celesio to unwind last year's deal. But continued ownership by Celesio of the wholesale arm would surely be off-limits on competition grounds - Celesio, Alliance Boots and Phoenix, another German company, dominate the European market. Furthermore, KKR's ally Stefano Pessina, the wholesaling brains behind the Alliance UniChem-Boots merger, has made clear he will not throw in his lot - and his 15 per cent stake - with another bidder. Alliance Boots' board is duty-bound to look at any sensible offer - and it would be good for other shareholders if somebody were to challenge Mr Pessina's stance. But, as the immobility of Alliance Boots' share price on Monday suggests, Celesio has a long way to go to convince the directors that it is serious enough to be given access to the accounts. Not yet free Carphone Warehouse investors, such as its new broadband customers, must learn to have patience. To bears, Monday's trading statement was a profit warning - unexpected and unwelcome - loading an additional GBP20m-GBP30m of costs on to the year to March 2008. To bulls, these costs are further necessary investments in promising areas, such as broadband and the joint ventures in the US and France. More detailed clues to the underlying performance - such as progress in integrating AOL's UK internet access business - will only be revealed to analysts later this month. Take the additional cost of broadband customer service. Overwhelmed by the success of its ""free"" Talk Talk offer last year, Carphone had to do some hasty hiring in order to cope with the demand. Charles Dunstone, the Carphone chief executive, employed his most winning manner on a blog in order to placate customers as they waited in line. His last posting was just before Christmas - which may or may not be a sign that things are getting better. On Monday, he told analysts: ""We've dragged ourselves up to the same bad level as the rest of the industry."" Half of the additional group costs for this financial year will pay for maintaining these additional staff, while the number of customers catches up and the number of complaints falls. Of course, if either measure moves in the other direction, those extra costs will persist. More positively, Carphone has managed to accelerate the migration of customers to ""unbundled"" lines. A bundled customer costs Carphone Warehouse GBP5 a month - mainly paid to BT for the privilege of using its exchanges - while an unbundled one generates GBP7 in profit. Although that trend was welcomed, some analysts trimmed their profit forecasts. Carphone Warehouse now trades on a multiple of 13 or 14 times prospective earnings for 2008. The 24 per cent decline in the share price since last October makes that seem fair. Wrist management Private equity's hold on British boardrooms goes beyond companies that are facing potential buy-outs, such as Alliance Boots or J Sainsbury. Most directors must have asked themselves in the past 12 months how they could apply some of private equity's techniques to their business. To help board members focus on value creation and balance sheet efficiency, it may therefore be time to mint a new rubber wristband - modelled on those worn by activist Christians in the US and elsewhere - with the legend WWPED: What Would Private Equity Do? andrew.hill@ft.com 55235714"

Celesio, the German pharmacy group, has hired NM Rothschild to sound out private equity firms to trump the approach of Stefano Pessina and KKR, his private equity backer. The German company, which owns the Lloydspharmacy chain in the UK, is in the early stages of trying to form a rival consortium that would try to top KKR's indicative GBP10.40-a-share offer and then split up Boots and share its assets. Although Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Boots, agreed last Friday to allow KKR and Mr Pessina to carry out due diligence - and the board has indicated it would approve a firm offer at GBP10.40 a share - he would also open the books to any other serious bidder. Meanwhile, Boots' pension trustees have commissioned an ""emergency valuation"" of its pension fund, underscoring the prospect that the scheme could stand in the way of a deal as it has in the other potential private equity acquisition of a FTSE 100 retailer - the CVC-led consortium's approach for J?Sainsbury, the supermarket chain. Trustees to the Boots pension scheme, suspecting the company could be the target of a highly leveraged bid, developed an action plan several months ago. On the day the company was approached last month, trustees and their advisers assembled at Boots' Nottingham headquarters. They are understood to have commissioned an emergency valuation to bring the scheme's assumptions up to date with variables such as the improving life expectancy of members. Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Friday said there could be a GBP2bn ""black hole"" in the Boots pension scheme. ""Since 2004 pension fund trustees have had wide-ranging powers,"" the research note warned. ""Their sole obligation is to protect members' interests. They have no obligations to shareholders and do not need to negotiate."" But KKR and Mr Pessina are understood to believe both obstacles will be surmounted. The Boots pension scheme is widely believed to be well-funded; it was one of the first to replace much of its equity assets with bonds. Mr Pessina, who is Boots' largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake, has ruled out working with a rival to KKR and has indicated he will likely walk away from the company if unsuccessful in his bid to take it private. 55214211"

He is expected to face an army of retail analysts on Thursday when he hosts the Alliance Boots annual results presentation. So it was highly provocative to dismiss them as ""stupid"" for undervaluing the health and beauty group until it attracted takeover interest from private equity in February. The company's analysts certainly have a case to answer. They, in common with shareholders, voiced scepticism about the GBP7.8bn merger of the Boots retail chain and Alliance Unichem, the drugs wholesaler, when Sir Nigel proposed the transaction in 2005. Citigroup's retail analysts spoke for many when they wrote: ""We fear that this deal has serious executional, managerial and possibly even regulatory risks. It is not the combination of two highly successful, high-return entities."" Yet anyone who listened to the analysts and shunned the shares upon the deal's completion last July would have missed out on a 45 per cent profit from the recently agreed GBP11bn, or GBP11.39-a-share, joint takeover bid from KKR and the company's executive deputy chairman, Stefano Pessina. KKR's offer came after its earlier GBP10.40-a-share bid, also recommended to shareholders by Sir Nigel, looked at risk of being trumped by Terra Firma, a rival private equity firm. The analyst community is already marshalling its arguments against the straight-talking Sir Nigel, although only a few number-crunchers are bold enough to take issue with him in public. ""Nigel Rudd is entitled to his views,"" says Richard Ratner of Seymour Pierce. ""Obviously if [the share price] went up we got it wrong. [But] I'm not going to bare my chest on this one. I think on fundamentals if the bid hadn't come the price would be less than GBP8. He is very lucky he got a bid."" In fact, few analysts had price targets for the stock as high as GBP8-a-share before KKR's interest emerged. One analyst describes Sir Nigel's comments as ""typically arrogant"", adding: ""He was the one who recommended GBP10.40 and said 'Oh, another 99p!'. He's not exactly covered himself in glory."" And according to one highly rated follower of the retail sector, the research community had good reason to be cautious about Alliance Boots, since information flow from the company was poor. ""Retail analysts were quite entitled to be sceptical,"" he says. ""You put two complicated businesses together and make a big complicated business - it's not surprising the market wants to see a bit of evidence?.?.?.?The board] didn't even take a stab at [putting a number on] revenue synergies."" One senior director responsible for research at a major brokerage firm says Sir Nigel was wrong to accuse analysts of missing the big picture - a reference to his comment that Alliance Boots's analysts did not ""sit back and say healthcare is a growing business, people are getting older, they need more medicine"". ""Analysts spend an increasing amount of time understanding the macro- drivers of a company. Industries are more interlinked globally than they have been,"" says the executive, who asked not to be named. It was pointed out that it was unfair to accuse analysts of undervaluing companies that receive generous takeover bids from private equity firms. ""Eighteen months ago, there wasn't a trillion dollars of private equity financing out there. The trouble is you don't know which company private equity is going to land on next, and you cannot put a buy-out valuation on every company in your universe,"" he says. ""The willingness of private equity to move into the sort of transaction that we have seen lately, thanks to the cheap financing, has as-tounded even themselves. It is striking that they weren't doing these deals two years ago when those companies were cheaper."" There was also criticism that Sir Nigel piled into analysts but was silent about the wider investor community, which showed little appetite for the stock. For months after the merger of Alliance Unichem and Boots was announced, the shares barely outperformed the FTSE 100 and underperformed the retail sector. ""His comments suggest the job of the analyst is to make the decision to buy or sell. To say analysts are stupid without saying the market is stupid too is an odd comment. The decision to buy or sell is the investor's."" Of course, it may be that the boardroom view of analysts is coloured by the tilt of their recommendations. At Asos, a retailer that is 100 times smaller than Alliance Boots but growing fast, analysts are very much in favour. Most analysts covering the stock are impressed with its proven ability to grow sales at a spectacular rate in spite of setbacks such as the Buncefield fuel depot explosion, which destroyed much of its stock. ""We have quite a positive view of them,"" says Nick Robertson, chief executive. ""We find it hard to predict our business, so an analyst trying to follow it is on a hiding to nothing."" 55799836"

With the reported period ending on September 15, ABF's results did not show the impact of the September 11 attacks but the company foresees an impact on consumer confidence. Other challenges listed for the year ahead include significantly lower UK sugar beet harvests and the tail of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. ABF's robust performance came at a cost, however. Part of that was the closure of three British Sugar factories.

At a thinly-attended shareholder meeting on Thursday, John Watson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Alliance Boots pension scheme, said it and the consortium had not yet reached agreement on additional funding. Mr Watson said the trustees ""have made it clear that the borrowings in excess of GBP8bn being taken on to finance this acquisition have serious implications for the scheme"". He said: ""We have still not reached a satisfactory agreement, which inevitably gives trustees serious worries about the future."" One pensions lawyer said the dispute was ""shaping up to be the showdown at the OK Corral"". Pensions lawyers believe that KKR, which has not yet received ""clearance"" for its transaction from the pensions watchdog, will challenge the latter's ability to insist trustees negotiate up-front payments from employers to fund deficits. The rules only apply to transactions that are structured to avoid paying pension liabilities. The regulator recently issued guidance urging trustees to seek clearance - a procedure that absolves them of personal liability in the event the employer later becomes insolvent - when corporate transactions pile on heavy new debts. However, lawyers said the regulator's ability to do so, while enshrined in the general spirit of the Pensions Act of 2004, was not specifically written into it. The KKR consortium said the group was not seeking a showdown with the trustees. ""We are working hard to achieve a constructive result,"" it said. Sir Nigel Rudd, Alliance Boots chairman, told shareholders: ""I will be pressing very hard for a resolution because we don't want people to be worried about their pensions."" However, at the shareholders' meeting, Kevin Taylor, a retired pharmacist who had worked for Boots for 35 years, said he ""felt unease"" over the buy-out.

The shares dropped 8lp to 758p, in spite of interim results at the top end of expectations, as the group spelt out in detail just how much of its operating profits - a quarter - come from that part of British Sugar that will be hit by regime change. That proportion is down from a third a year ago but it is still a sizeable chunk of the business to be under threat. There is a long way to go before the European Commission's proposals are finalised, and the first serious impact on profits will not be seen until 2007. But some indication of the way things will move could come later this month, when the result of the appeal against last October's World Trade Organisation ruling is published. It could turn out that British Sugar has to close factories or buy quota from other producers. At present analysts are pencilling in a halving of British Sugar's profits over the next five years, in which case the group will have to run hard elsewhere to keep profits moving ahead. Fortunately, all those profits from British Sugar over the years have been put to good use so far, poured into businesses such as Primark and acquisitions. But the pressure will be on to spend the remaining cash on more deals, and there are plenty of businesses available for sale now. George Weston, the new chief executive, sounds likely to be as careful as his father was in spending shareholders' money. But the next few years could put the family philosophy that short-term pain is worth it for long-term gain to the test, and try the patience of investors with a less generational perspective than the Westons. Monsoon storms ahead A strong trading performance can be a powerful response to charges of poor corporate governance. Certainly Peter Simon, Monsoon chairman and controller of 75 per cent of the shares, has used it like this before. On Tuesday there was more positive news as Monsoon said it was buying 47 former Etam stores for GBP43m and that current trading was in line with expectations. The announcement raised the share price to 306lp. But this comes with a sting in the tail: the share price is more than double the level of the put option available when the fashion retailer controversially abandoned its main listing in 2003. There are good reasons for Tuesday's rise. The trading update suggests underlying sales growth, in contrast to rivals such as Next. Meanwhile, the row with discount retailer Primark about low-cost copying of designs signals that Monsoon's margins are healthy. At the same time, the deal will increase UK retail space by about 30 per cent, and is the second purchase of a bundle of stores within a year. While the UK market is mature, competitive and difficult, it is also less risky than expanding in Russia, the other market Monsoon is targeting. Minority investors may have disliked Mr Simon's decision to stop dividend payments in order to fund expansion without borrowing, but at least the money is being well-spent. Numis, the house broker, has raised its current year pre-tax profit forecast by GBP2m to GBP57m, and for next year by GBP7m to GBP68m, putting the stock on a forward p/e of 14, falling to 12. The retail performance deserves a better rating: being part of Mr Simon's fiefdom does not. Fear of fining Please, please don't go the way of those rough, aggressive American financial policemen, imposing heavy fines on us and targeting industry executives. That was the call on Tuesday from the British Bankers' Association to the Financial Services Authority, which is conducting a review of its enforcement processes. The review is not really concerned with the fining regime, but no matter, it is part of the general enforcement fabric and is a matter of concern to the BBA. The association fears that political and media pressures may push the FSA to be too focused on large fines and ensuring reputational damage to firms and individuals. This, it warns, could do untold damage to the existing culture of regulation in the UK, where the open dialogue between regulator and regulated contrasts sharply with the US. Well, yes, but there is precious little evidence of the FSA going all American. The example the BBA cites - the splits affair - was hardly an example of Spitzer-like terror. And its fining regime is, if anything, still a little on the light side relative to offences. Royal Dutch/Shell got a GBP17m fine - four times that of the largest previous one - but that was a long way behind the GBP66m imposed on the company in the US. And fines on individuals have so far run to no more than a few hundred thousand pounds. The BBA is rightly concerned that a balance be achieved. But the spectre it raises looks, for now, insubstantial. martin.dickson@ft.com 41860263"

""I love you Stuart."" ""And I love you, George."" This may not be entirely faithful to the kiss and make-up conversation evidently held by Stuart Rose, chief executive of Marks and Spencer, and George Davies, who has agreed to stay, just three weeks after announcing he would quit. But it perhaps captures the problem faced by companies in trying to deal with a huge but volatile creative talent like Mr Davies. His agreement to stay on full time at per una until next summer and then become chairman, working at least two days a week, has a number of holes, most notably his salary as chairman. But it gives M&S breathing space to organise an orderly succession for chief executive and means Mr Davies will not now be competing with M&S and diverting his energies into Giv-e, his plan for a new high street and internet business. Perhaps, at 64, he feels on reflection more comfortable where he is. Per una, with some GBP250m of sales, is not huge in relation to M&S's annual turnover of GBP8bn, but it generates foot traffic and a touch of flair that helps perceptions of the chain - when it is not arguing with Mr Davies. Mr Rose deserves an award for diplomacy, if not services to the arts. Associated British Foods denies it, but some analysts believe that when the group is choosing where to site Primark stores, it tries to get locations near Marks and Spencer so that it benefits from M&S footfall and draws in shoppers who have seen M&S prices. Whatever the theory, it obviously works. The discount retailer produced underlying sales growth of 12 per cent in the six months to mid-September and raised full-year operating profit from GBP108m to GBP140m - a substantial chunk of ABF's GBP487m group total. Moreover, it is investing for a step-change in growth next year as stores acquired from Littlewoods and Allders come fully onstream. The programme of integrating a 60 per cent increase in space must carry some executional risk, but ABF is not rushing it and its management is well-regarded. Of course, there is the rest, indeed the bulk, of the group. There were mixed results from groceries and a weak second half from the primary food and agriculture businesses including British Sugar. None of these is critical right now. Primark is to ABF what sucralose is to Tate &Lyle - a star from the 1970s that more than makes up for changes coming to the EU sugar regime. But it is hard to be a star in secret and its strength is clearly in the ABF share price. With pre-tax profit forecasts between GBP610m and GBP625m, the shares are on a price/earnings ratio of about 15 times. This looks fully priced and certainly less of a bargain than anything flying off the shelves at Primark. John Duffield is a very fine marketing man, so he should be pleased by a 23 per cent rise in the share price of his New Star Asset Management on the first day of dealings. This will send out a positive investment message. Since Mr Duffield himself was not selling any shares, he will not be concerned about money left on the table. Indeed, only 14.7 per cent of the equity was being sold and a lack of liquidity may have helped first day trading of an issue priced to go well. The current valuation of roughly 18 times forward normalised earnings is higher than UK peers. They are on 15 times 2006 earnings, reckons Morgan Stanley, with US groups on 16-21. But the gap can be justified: New Star is growing strongly - net new assets under management were up 28 per cent in the first nine months - while UK rivals are on average experiencing 5 per cent annual outflows. That growth will moderateas it expands, as will operating margins, currently bolstered by modest pay and share options that are locked in until 2009. But that is some way off. 45466271"

Lord Reith will look down on Thursday's proceedings, but other former directors general have been found new homes. An addition to the collection will be unveiled next month, but Greg Dyke, smarting already from his failed attempt to take control of ITV, will have to glower from a wall in White City. There wasn't a single question from the floor for Chris Gibson-Smith and Clara Furse from the handful of London Stock Exchange shareholders gathered at JPMorgan Cazenove's offices to vote on a GBP510m pay-out. Flanked by journalists on one side and bankers and advisers on the other, investors opted not to press the LSE's chairman and chief executive on what the future might hold. A delegation from Changsha, capital of China's Hunan province, will host an investment conference next Tuesday in London. There will also be fireworks at the London Eye, courtesy of Liuyang city in Hunan, which claims to be ""capital of fireworks in this world"".

The company, which had said in February that difficulties in the European sugar market would cause profits from this business to fall, reported a rise in revenues of 10 per cent to GBP2.89bn ($5.14bn), while pre-tax profits dropped by 13 per cent to GBP234m for the 24 weeks ended March 4. ""Looking beyond the current year, the transition to the new EU sugar regime may well continue to impact on profits through 2006/7. We are confident that when the transition to the new regime is completed British Sugar will be satisfactorily profitable."" In primary foods, which houses British Sugar, profits declined by 32 per cent to GBP53m. ""Imbalances in supply and demand within the EU sugar market and changes in producer behaviour in anticipation of the new regime resulted in more severe price pressure than had been expected. Profits were further eroded by a weaker euro and higher energy costs in the UK."" But there was better news at retailer Primark which reported a 20 per cent rise in operating profit to GBP71m, on revenues which rose 18 per cent to GBP530m despite a warehouse fire last November. The benefit of trading profits from Littlewoods stores, which it acquired last July and which comprises 120 stores, had ended and there would be net interest payable in the second half reflecting the investment in fitting out stores. ""As a consequence, some reduction in [group] earnings after tax can be expected in the second half compared with the previous year."" Richard Workman, analyst with Oriel Securities, said in an early research note: ""ABF is having to sit through a painful transition period in EU sugar, while the greatly expanded Primark business is a year off full conversion. Medium term this is a classic conglomerate story, well run and with clear opportunities in all divisions. It's not cheap, but it remains a clear medium term quality play."" In the grocery division which houses brands such as Ryvita crispbreads, the Twinings tea brand and Silver Spoon Sugar revenue increased by 5 per cent to GBP1.3bn while profits rose by 1 per cent to GBP85m. Overall profits increases were held back by lower volumes at Allied Bakeries, commissioning costs at the new Sydney bakery and lower sugar pricing in Silver Spoon. Profits at the ingredients division rose by 32 per cent to GBP33m. The company is in the midst of preparing a formal offer for a controlling stake in Illovo Sugar, the largest producer in Africa. A stake in the pan-African company would help ABF circumvent recent changes in EU sugar quotas. Group operating profit rose 5 per cent to GBP255m. The interim dividend rose by 4 per cent to 6.25p. Earnings per share dropped by 16 per cent to 21p. Shares in ABF were down 3 per cent to 816p in early trade in London. 48412426"

The shares dropped 8lp to 758p, in spite of interim results at the top end of expectations, as the group spelt out in detail just how much of its operating profits - a quarter - come from that part of British Sugar that will be hit by regime change. That proportion is down from a third a year ago but it is still a sizeable chunk of the business to be under threat. There is a long way to go before the European Commission's proposals are finalised, and the first serious impact on profits will not be seen until 2007. But some indication of the way things will move could come later this month, when the result of the appeal against last October's World Trade Organisation ruling is published. It could turn out that British Sugar has to close factories or buy quota from other producers. At present analysts are pencilling in a halving of British Sugar's profits over the next five years, in which case the group will have to run hard elsewhere to keep profits moving ahead. Fortunately, all those profits from British Sugar over the years have been put to good use so far, poured into businesses such as Primark and acquisitions. But the pressure will be on to spend the remaining cash on more deals, and there are plenty of businesses available for sale now. George Weston, the new chief executive, sounds likely to be as careful as his father was in spending shareholders' money. But the next few years could put the family philosophy that short-term pain is worth it for long-term gain to the test, and try the patience of investors with a less generational perspective than the Westons. Monsoon storms ahead A strong trading performance can be a powerful response to charges of poor corporate governance. Certainly Peter Simon, Monsoon chairman and controller of 75 per cent of the shares, has used it like this before. On Tuesday there was more positive news as Monsoon said it was buying 47 former Etam stores for GBP43m and that current trading was in line with expectations. The announcement raised the share price to 306lp. But this comes with a sting in the tail: the share price is more than double the level of the put option available when the fashion retailer controversially abandoned its main listing in 2003. There are good reasons for Tuesday's rise. The trading update suggests underlying sales growth, in contrast to rivals such as Next. Meanwhile, the row with discount retailer Primark about low-cost copying of designs signals that Monsoon's margins are healthy. At the same time, the deal will increase UK retail space by about 30 per cent, and is the second purchase of a bundle of stores within a year. While the UK market is mature, competitive and difficult, it is also less risky than expanding in Russia, the other market Monsoon is targeting. Minority investors may have disliked Mr Simon's decision to stop dividend payments in order to fund expansion without borrowing, but at least the money is being well-spent. Numis, the house broker, has raised its current year pre-tax profit forecast by GBP2m to GBP57m, and for next year by GBP7m to GBP68m, putting the stock on a forward p/e of 14, falling to 12. The retail performance deserves a better rating: being part of Mr Simon's fiefdom does not. Fear of fining Please, please don't go the way of those rough, aggressive American financial policemen, imposing heavy fines on us and targeting industry executives. That was the call on Tuesday from the British Bankers' Association to the Financial Services Authority, which is conducting a review of its enforcement processes. The review is not really concerned with the fining regime, but no matter, it is part of the general enforcement fabric and is a matter of concern to the BBA. The association fears that political and media pressures may push the FSA to be too focused on large fines and ensuring reputational damage to firms and individuals. This, it warns, could do untold damage to the existing culture of regulation in the UK, where the open dialogue between regulator and regulated contrasts sharply with the US. Well, yes, but there is precious little evidence of the FSA going all American. The example the BBA cites - the splits affair - was hardly an example of Spitzer-like terror. And its fining regime is, if anything, still a little on the light side relative to offences. Royal Dutch/Shell got a GBP17m fine - four times that of the largest previous one - but that was a long way behind the GBP66m imposed on the company in the US. And fines on individuals have so far run to no more than a few hundred thousand pounds. The BBA is rightly concerned that a balance be achieved. But the spectre it raises looks, for now, insubstantial. martin.dickson@ft.com 41860263"

Thais appear to be increasing their taste for the malted drink, available in draught form in milk bars, and which saw sales increase in the country, now Ovaltine's single biggest market by 30 per cent. This performance helped boost sales in the international groceries arm, which accounts for 48 per cent of sales and which saw sales grow 7 per cent to GBP1.24bn ($2.36bn) and profit rise 23 per cent to GBP86m. A recovery in the oils business and strong sales growth in other hot beverage brands such as Twinings also helped. The group, which supplies half the UK's requirement for sugar, said the contribution from British Sugar in the UK was a little over a quarter of total operating profits compared to around a third a year earlier. Under the current EU sugar quota regime, which runs until June 2006, UK sugar production is dominated by only two companies, British Sugar, which is owned by Associated British Foods, and Tate &Lyle. Overall, the group's performance was boosted by organic growth and the benefit of acquisitions, notably last year's purchase of the herbs and spices business of Burns, Philp. Pre-tax profits rose to GBP252m, on turnover which rose 10 per cent to GBP2.63bn, for the 24 weeks ended March 5. In primary foods and agriculture, which contributes about 28 per cent of sales, strong yields from good quality beet offset the effect of a smaller crop area. But UK profit had been affected by an oversupply of sugar in the EU this year, which is expected to continue to have an impact throughout the second half. ""Reform of the European sugar regime is the most significant strategic issue facing British Sugar. We expect that the new arrangements (by the EC) will still provide for efficient companies to be able to make an adequate return on the investment they have made in the industry,"" it said. In the ingredients business, which contributes 10 per cent of sales, sales and profit more than doubled, boosted by recent acquisitions of the international yeast and bakery ingredients business. In retail, which now accounts for 17 per cent of sales, Primark saw like-for-like sales, which strip out the effects of new space, rise by 6 per cent, against the backdrop of a tough retail environment. Sales grew 12 per cent overall to reach GBP448m. ""Clothing retailing is as competitive a market as any at the present time. The performance of Primark is therefore particularly satisfying,"" it said. The company said that while the operating environment will be no less demanding in the second period of the year, ""we nevertheless expect to report good progress in operating profit for the full year. However, net investment income will be significantly lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. ""Even after the major acquisitions referred to in this statement, our financial resources remain strong and will enable the group to support new investment initiatives."" Group operating profit rose 15 per cent to GBP214m. Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 22.9p. AB's interim dividend rose to 6p per share, up 14 per cent.

Darren Shirley, analyst with Shore Capital, said ""This is a concern. Sales were effectively flat as we saw like-for-like sales growth of 6 per cent in the first half. We would be worried if we were to see this trend continuing into the first half of next year, but you have to remember that they are trading against tough comparisons with last year."" The sales figures were based on a little over half of current selling space, and exclude new and extended stores for their first year of trading, unlike supermarkets which include extended stores in like-for-like sales figures. Primark is bolstering its presence significantly through the conversion of 120 town centre stores formerly owned by Littlewoods, which it bought last year. It said the programme for the refit and opening of the former Littlewoods stores was on scehdule and it expects 18 stores to be trading by year end. The news came as the company said that the reduction in second-half earnings, flagged up in April, would be in line with expectations. It had warned that soaring energy costs and weak trading at its bakery operations would hit second-half profits. The company has also been hit by turmoil in the European sugar market during the transition phase of European Union sugar reform, At British Sugar, imbalances in supply and demand within the EU market and changes in producer behaviour in anticipation of the new regime in the first half resulted in price pressure. Earlier this month, ABF acquired a 51 per cent interest in Illovo Sugar, the largest sugar producer in Africa and one of the world's leading low-cost producers, for GBP286m. A full year's trading will be consolidated into next year's income for the group. ABF is expected gradually to shift its sugar prodution out of the UK to low-cost factories in Africa in the wake of changes to sugar quotas by the EU. Under new EU laws, sugar from poor African coutnries can be imported freely into the European market from 2009 while subsidies for domestic producters are cut. It said on Monday: ""Well over half our sugar production next year will be outside the EU. Despite difficulties in the sugar market, ABF shares have recently been boosted by ABF's tie up with DuPont and BP, to use its fermentation plant in Wissington, Norfolk to manufacture biobutanol. The company said on Monday that discussions were continuing to develop detailed plans for production. Biolbutanol, which can be made from sugar or cereal, has several advantages over ethanol, notably its higher energy content and that it can be more easily blended with conventional petrol. At the grocery division, its brands Twinings, Ovaltine, Ryvita, Capullo and Westmill all achieved strong profit growth. Profit at Silver Spoon was affected by pricing pressure on granulated sugar. Trading was ""particularly difficult"" at Allied Bakeries with lower volumes of both Kingsmill and own label significantly reducing profitability as expected. ""The new management team is making progress in dealing with the issues,"" it said. It said that interest payable net of investment income, would be considerably higher than last year, but said that the recent weakening of the US dollar, which has reduced operating profit of US dollar earnings on translations, had benefited the interest payable on US dollar earnings.

The full-year results announced on Tuesday suggest that each limb is getting pinched. The UK company, which is 55 percent owned by the family of chief executive George Weston, met consensus estimates by posting a 13 per cent year-on-year increase in revenues and an 11 per cent rise in operating profit, pre-exceptionals. But investors reacted unhappily to Mr Weston's relatively sombre tone, beating the shares down 2.5 per cent in early trading. Primark, the retail arm, now the UK's second largest retailer by volume, has long been a bright spot. Sales rose 37 per cent year-on-year, thanks to the opening of 27 new stores, including its first big presence on London's Oxford Street. But Primark's like-for-like sales were less impressive, rising just 1 per cent year-on-year. Only 9 new stores are planned next year. Whether and when Primark can replace breakneck expansion with underlying sales growth remains an unanswered question. But the fact that five of the new shops will be in Spain suggests that the UK may be reaching saturation point. Meanwhile, rising commodity prices and the falling US dollar are squeezing margins in the conglomerate's grocery divisions, where operating profits fell nearly 16 percent year-on-year. But the clouds may be parting for ABF's core sugar business - its geographical diversity should help the company weather next year's hit from EU sugar quota restructuring. With the addition of South Africa-based Illovo, two-thirds of ABF sugar is now produced outside the EU, and further expansion in China is expected. The medium-term outlook for the overall company is also brighter, assuming ABF passes on more commodity price increases.

The results came despite losses at the Kingsmill bread business and lower profits at the British Sugar. The weak dollar had a GBP13m impact on translating profits into sterling. Adjusted pre-tax profits for the year to September 15, excluding amortisation and one-off items, rose 10 per cent to GBP613m on revenues up 13 per cent to GBP6.8bn. The shares opened weaker, falling 2 per cent or 18p to 894p in initial trading on Tuesday. Operating profits at Primark increased by 20 per cent to GBP200m, accounting for nearly one-third of group profits. Sales increased 37 per cent though on a like-for-like basis growth was 1 per cent, hurt by poor summer weather and the impact of new store openings on existing shops. George Weston, chief executive, said the rate of expansion in the UK would slow and in Spain the group would move from two to seven stores as it went from ""test to roll-out"" a move he said was ""significant"". ABF also benefitted from its purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Illovo, the southern African sugar cane comany, which performed better than had been expected. However, Mr Weston said EU reforms designed to remove oversupply, had reduced profits in ABF's sugar beet processing business, costing GBP30m, and profits from this area would be hit even harder in the current year. John Bason, finance director, said the changes to the EU regime were now being finalised and profits should begin to recover again before the transition period ended in 2010. Operating profits from the sugar division rose 73 per cent to GBP199m as Illovo was included for its first year and there was a ""substantial"" rise in profits from China. ABF is to spend GBP100m expanding Illovo's cane growing area by 50 per cent, while in China it invested in a beet sugar business in August. Losses at Allied Bakeries in the UK, which makes Kingsmill bread, reduced in the second half. This followed a relaunch of the brand in February, which helped it regain some market share. Mr Weston said the improvement was continuing, however, the price of flour for breadmaking had doubled over the year and despite a price rise earlier in the autumn, the group needed to negotiate another. The bread baking problems affected the grocery division where operating profits fell by GBP29m to GBP153m, although a number of its other brands such as Twinings tea and Ovaltine hot drinks, continued to perform well. ABF spent GBP489m on expansion during the year, but Mr Bason said the balance sheet remained strong with net debt rising by only GBP13m to GBP311m. Adjusted earnings per share rose 4 per cent to 52.9p. A final dividend of 13p is proposed to take the total for the year to 19.5p a rise of 4 per cent. On a statutory basis, pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent to GBP508m, and earnings per share by 23 per cent to 46.7p. 59877461"

The involvement of Mr Pessina, executive deputy chairman and leading shareholder in the target, raised almost intolerable conflicts of interest. They remained unresolved even at the kill - although the emergence of a counter-bidder allowed shareholders to set them to one side and reap a rich reward. Now the real circus begins. Under private equity, the drug wholesaling and pharmacy group's performance, its managers' rewards, its treatment of staff and its relations with customers and suppliers will be scrutinised. The one thing this company will not be is ""private"". That is how it should be. A lot is riding on the success of this takeover - and not just for KKR and Mr Pessina. This is the highest-profile buy-out of a listed UK company and the most important to take place since unions and some Labour politicians started to whinge about the predations of private equity. It is happening in the shadow of industry talks about a voluntary disclosure code, which means Alliance Boots' promised ""annual reviews"" could set a benchmark for openness - or become a whipping boy for the sector's perceived lack of transparency. KKR is also the first buy-out firm to have stated so publicly and so explicitly at the outset that expansion of the target company is its objective and that job creation will be a by-product. Mr Pessina argues that, both in wholesaling and retailing, he will be able to drive Alliance Boots faster as a privately held group than as a listed company. But if he hopes this will happen away from the public hurly-burly he has experienced over the past few weeks, he should think again. Failure to meet the loudly stated goals of this deal - and to explain progress along the way - could rebound on the whole private equity industry. It is a big responsibility. KKR's peers must hope that Mr Pessina is ready to shoulder it. Elephants and a mouse Almost everyone agrees that it is undesirable for the audit of the world's big companies to be dominated by four firms, but because of the criss-crossing and sometimes contradictory interests of investors, issuers and auditors themselves, a solution looks as far off as ever it was. That is the dispiriting conclusion that must be drawn from the latest report from the Financial Reporting Council, the regulatory body that has arguably made the most fuss about dominance. Its members have laboured where others have not, but they have given birth to the proverbial mouse, whose loudest squeak is a ""provisional recommendation"" to promote (subject to safeguards, mind) wider understanding of the possible effects of changes to rules on audit firm ownership. Progress is slow, in part because the gulf between the Big Four and the so-called Following Five is tolerated by the market, with both groups seemingly comfortable in their respective patches. For the accountancy wonks of London and Washington, the creation of a fifth audit giant from scratch looks either far off or fantasy, whether outside capital is permitted or not (although who is willing to bet that Beijing has no blueprints for a 21st century audit firm with Chinese characteristics?). Break-up by the competition authorities is too radical: ""Smash the Big Four's oligopoly!"" is a slogan destined to remain on the working group's cutting-room floor. Still, if participants cannot agree on less mealy-mouthed ""market-based"" measures to bridge the gap, they should be threatened with the stick of bolder regulatory intervention. Curb your enthusiasm Primark may be changing the shape of British clothes retailing, but there was nothing like the same hysteria in evidence for its parent's interim results on Tuesday as for the chain's Oxford Street opening earlier this month. Apart from Primark, Associated British Foods is steward of brands such as Kingsmill in bread and Silver Spoon in sugar - the sort of eclectic mix of businesses that often tempts private equity to hazard a break-up bid. But ABF is controlled by the Westons, who show no sign of wishing to reshuffle the portfolio, let alone sell out. The shares have had a strong run over the past three months and already stand at more than 16 times 2007-08 earnings. Not worth beating the doors down for. andrew.hill@ft.com 55675509"

On an unadjusted basis pre-tax profits were GBP198m (GBP234m) after losses on sales of businesses and amortisation of intangibles. George Weston, chief executive, said the advances made by the two divisions were ""the beginning of the benefits we expect"". Primark, which has been the fastest expanding part of the grocery and retail group, which owns brands such as Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Silver Spoon sugar, raised interim sales by 36 per cent to GBP721m and operating profits by 28 per cent to GBP91m. Primark, which sells value for money fashion ranges and household goods, opened its first central London store in Oxford Street earlier this month, with mounted policemen required to control the crowds. Like for like sales in the half year to March 3 were flat in Primark, and gains came from the addition of 1.5m sq ft of selling space taking the total to 4.4m sq ft. Some expect the group to expand Primark internationally, and the group said it was ""very encouraged"" by early trading in two stores it has opened in Spain. The group's UK sugar business has been affected in recent years by reform of the EU sugar regime but the company said profits here were unchanged in the half year as cost savings and efficiencies offset a quota cut and a restructuring levy. The rest of the primary food and agriculture division gained from improvements in ABF's Polish and Chinese sugar operations, and the inclusion of Illovo, the southern African sugar business the group took a majority stake in last year. The worst performing division was grocery, were operating profits fell from GBP84m to GBP64m largely as a result of a poor performance in the Allied Bakeries bread business.

The proposed acquisition is in line with recent comments from ABF, which owns grocery brands such as Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings tea and Patak's curry sauces and chutneys, that it wanted to use its financial strength to expand at a time when other food companies are under pressure. However, the shares fell 34½p to 623½p as analysts said the deal would dilute earnings in the short term and they did not think that sugar, seen as a commodity business, should be the focus of acquisition efforts. ABF is the second-largest sugar producer in the world, with operations in China and southern Africa as well as the UK and Poland. Ebro's sugar business, Azucarera Ebro, is the leading supplier in the Iberian region with a 50 per cent share of the market. It is constructing a refinery at Guadalete, near Cadiz and ABF had already signed a long-term agreement with the company to supply raw cane sugar to it from its Illovo subsidiary, which operates across southern Africa. John Bason, ABF finance director, said he was pleased with the deal's price, which is about eight times Azucarera's €48m of earnings before interest and tax in 2007. Profits from ABF's EU sugar business have fallen sharply in recent years, in common with other European sugar producers, as the EU sugar regime has undergone fundamental change. That is now almost complete and companies are looking to improve profits once more. The process has left the Iberian peninsular producing far less sugar than is consumed in the region. Tate & Lyle, which has a sugar refinery in Portugal, recently said there were signs of sugar price improvement in the Iberian peninsular as a result of that deficit. Ebro decided in May to sell its sugar business to concentrate on its rice, dairy and pasta activities. Ebro would also receive a further €141m from elsewhere, largely payments under the EU sugar restructuring fund. 20081120_12003_539.xml"

ABF, which also owns Silver Spoon sugar, Mazola oils and the Primark chain of discount shops, took a 20 per cent stake in the family-owned Jordan company in September last year for a price rumoured at the time to be about £15m. In the cashless merger of Ryvita and Jordans, ABF will end up with 62 per cent of the enlarged company. Its chief executive will be Paul Murphy, who is transferring from ABF's Twinings tea subsidiary, and it will retain both Bill and David Jordan, brothers and founders of the firm, on the board as fully involved executives. Their mother still runs the shop at the mill in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. John Bason, finance director of ABF, said the healthy eating sector was a growth area of the food market which was attractive for the group. The merged company would have had sales of about £135m in its past financial year, and Mr Bason expected these to increase as the combined business attacked new retail channels, such as convenience stores and the ""grab and go"" impulse market. Cost savings and benefits from the merger should mean the business is capable of making a 10 per cent trading profit margin in due course, he said. He said there were no plans at present to close either Ryvita's or Jordan's factories, but there would be savings among back office costs. Mr Bason said ABF expected benefits from the Jordan and Ryvita combination similar to those it had gained after merging its Patak's and Blue Dragon ethnic foods companies, and its Twinings and Ovaltine hot drinks businesses. Shares in ABF fell 20½p to 841p. ● Mr Bason declined to comment on the last-minute decision by Channel Four not to air a documentary The Devil Wears Primark on Sunday night, which was billed to be about UK retailers' sourcing of low-priced clothing ranges. 20080602_2293_21.xml"

The group, whose brands include Kingsmill bread, Ovaltine drinks, Silver Spoon sugar and Ryvita crispbread, blamed a ""substantial margin reduction"" at ACH, its North American edible oils business which includes the Mazola brand, and downtrading by consumers for an expected fall in profits from its grocery division. It said that adjusted operating profits for the half-year to February 28 would be slightly down on the £296m reported a year ago, but it still expected adjusted earnings for the full year to be little changed. However, ABF will also take £80m in exceptional charges. Of that, £60m relates to the merger of ACH with the packaged oils business of US group Archer Daniels Midland to form a 50:50 joint venture called Stratas Foods, announced last October. The charge will be shown as a loss on disposal, with £17m of the £60m taken as a cash cost. There will also be a £20m charge relating to fair value accounting on the acquisition, due to complete this spring, of Azucarera Ebro, the Iberian sugar processor. Primark achieved a 5 per cent increase in like-for-like sales in the half year, ABF said, showing a better performance than most of the UK high street. However, the costs of operating a new, larger distribution centre would weigh on margins, the group cautioned. The new warehouse is designed to cope with expansion of the chain, which is due to open its first shops in Germany and Portugal in the second half of its financial year. Primark has 12 shops in Spain. ABF said its European and South African sugar businesses performed well in the half year, offsetting a weaker showing in its Chinese sugar subsidiary. Its agriculture activities, such as animal feeds, also had a good first half with higher prices covering raised input costs. Grocery profits were being hit by the difficulties at ACH, where sharp rises in oil prices last year caused volume declines, and the subsequent fall in prices left ABF with long positions in vegetable oil futures at above market levels. The division was also affected by consumers in Australia trading down to own-label products. However, the UK bread business traded well and profits at Twinings Ovaltine, the hot drinks business, were ahead. ABF's ingredients businesses made good progress, the group said, and would also benefit from the translation of profits into sterling. The group is finalising a $600m private placement with UK and US institutional lenders. The debt would diversify sources of finance and have an average maturity of 6.7 years, but the fixed coupon on the notes would be higher than current variable bank rates, leading to higher interest charges in the second half. 20090223_14590_353.xml"

John Bason, finance director, said on Tuesday that one effect of the weaker pound would be a reduction in Primark's margins in the ""10s of basis points"" range as ABF bought clothes from China and India pegged to the dollar. George Weston, chief executive, said it was too early to say whether Primark - which has ridden the wave of cash-strapped consumers trading down - would have to put its prices up, as some of the effect would be offset by cheaper costs elsewhere. Primark enjoyed like-for-like sales growth of 5 per cent in the half-year and Mr Weston said it had ""entered the second half with a similar sort of momentum"". He was ""comfortable"" with Easter trading. The comments came as ABF reported a fall in pre-tax profit from £267m ($392m) to £178m in the 24 weeks to February 28, primarily due to a £60m charge in relation to the merger of its North American edible oils business with Archer Daniels Midland. Underlying profit fell by a better-than-expected 2 per cent to £275m, driven by Primark and an improvement in sugar. The grocery division fared less well, however, after ABF bought future supplies of corn oil at high prices. The grocery division was also hit by customers trading down from brands such as Twinings Tea. Sales of foods used by Indian and Chinese restaurants also fell as households cut back on take-aways. However, people are buying more curry sauces and home-baking products are up by double digits in the US. ""This is entertaining your kids on the weekend without going to the theme park,"" Mr Weston said. Net debt was £1.14bn, £352m higher than at the year end. The financial turmoil turned an £85m pension surplus into a £274m deficit. An interim dividend of 6.9p (6.75p) is payable from earnings per share of 17.6p (25.6p). ●FT Comment While pressure in the sugar market is off, ABF faces headwinds in the form of higher buying costs at Primark and recessionary conditions in grocery. Credit Suisse is forecasting flat full-year pre-tax profit of £632m, and earnings per share of 55.15p. The shares, which rose 32p to 686p, trade on a forward price/earnings ratio of about 12, a premium to the food producers. While this is justified by the presence of Primark in the group, a higher mark-up would look excessive, given the challenges that remain. 20090421_28823_200.xml"

No price was disclosed for the deal but John Bason, ABF finance director, said the Polish unit had sales of about £100m ($165m) a year and was profitable. It also had gross assets of £200m at August 31 2008. Analysts at Cazenove estimated that the proceeds of the disposal could be £120m-£130m. Mr Bason said the deal represented a tidying up of ABF's portfolio. He said the group had a strong sugar business in the UK and it had also recently acquired Spanish sugar producer Azucarera Ebro, making it number one in Iberian markets. It was number four in the Polish market, however. Profits from ABF's European Union sugar business have fallen sharply in recent years, in common with other European sugar producers, as the EU sugar regime has undergone fundamental change. That is now almost complete and companies are looking to improve profits once more. ""A lot of the changes to the sugar regime have finished now,"" said Mr Bason. ""We know what sort of regime we have got for a number of years, and there is a lot of change and consolidation going on."" George Weston, chief executive of ABF, said: ""Our market-leading positions with British Sugar in the UK and Azucarera Ebro in Iberia combine to give us a strong presence in the rapidly consolidating EU sugar market."" Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec Securities, said: ""This is all about ABF tidying up their European sugar operations and focusing on countries where they have scale and competitive advantage."" Cazenove said the disposal made ""good strategic sense, in our view. Azucarera Ebro is [much] better positioned for the import of least-developed countries' sugar into the EU, which will be permitted from October 2009"". From October, cane sugar from the least-developed countries has tariff-free access to Europe.

ABF said it expected Primark to achieve an annual like-for-like sales rise of 7 per cent. John Bason, finance director, said like-for-like sales growth would be ""approaching 9 per cent"" in the second half of Primark's financial year to September 12. Primark's momentum is in stark contrast to mid-market retailers, such as Next and Marks and Spencer, which reported declines in like-for-like sales for the first half of this year. Mr Bason said Primark's sales had been boosted by shoppers tightening their purse strings during the recession, but also by good weather and a more fundamental shift towards consumers hunting out the cheaper products offered by the discount retailers. ""There is a change in the way that people are shopping,"" he said. ""That probably, if anything, has been accelerated by the recession."" However, Mr Bason said Primark's gross margin would be reduced by a figure in the ""10s of basis points"" range from the impact of the fall in sterling earlier this year. Nevertheless, the surge in sales at Primark, and recovery in its European sugar business, prompted ABF to declare it expected ""some progress"" in adjusted earnings in the year to September. Previously, it had expected earnings to be flat. It made pre-tax profits of £632m ($1.03bn) in the year to September 2008. The shares rose 33½p to 845½p. Profits in the European sugar business are being boosted by stability in the European sugar market following a period of fundamental change in the industry. ""We have turned the corner,"" said Mr Bason. ""For people saying 'is it ever going to come through?' here is the proof of the pudding."" ABF said that net debt at the year end would be close to the £1.14bn reported at the half year stage. As Primark customers have been snapping up boyfriend jackets and skinny jeans, investors have been buying into its parent. ABF shares have risen about 15 per cent in the past three months, outperforming the FTSE 100 by about 3 per cent. Earnings per share this year of about 56p, where some analysts are expected to settle following Monday's profit upgrade, put the shares on a p/e ratio of about 15 times.

In a pre-close trading update, ABF said like-for-like sales at Primark, which accounts for about 40 per cent of group profits, were expected to grow 7 per cent over the full year thanks to a ""a very strong performance"" in the UK. ABF also noted that Primark had advanced its plans to expand in continental Europe, where it has increasingly sought to replicate its British and Irish popularity. During the second half, it expects to open two stores in Spain, where it has 13 branches, and trial stores in Germany and Portugal, in addition to two extra stores in the UK. John Bason, ABF finance director, highlighted Spain and Holland, where Primark opened its first store in 2008 in Rotterdam, as a particular targets for rapid growth. The only limitation would be the company's ability to find quality sites, he said. ABF said profits at Primark would be ""well ahead"" of last year, but noted that operating profit margins would decline because of higher fixed overheads at its new UK distribution centre and the impact of a weak pound on dollar-denominated goods. Mr Bason said that the performance had helped drive operating profis for the second half ahead of last year and noted that although interest charges would be higher as a result of acquisitions, adjusted full-year earnings would improve. Net debt would also return to roughly the £1.1bn level noted in the results for the first half of the year, thanks to a series of rights issues at its African sugar businesses and advanced consideration for the sale of its Polish sugar business. Analysts at Panumure Gordon described the Primark update as ""stunning"" and nudged their full year earnings per share forecast 2 per cent higher to 56p. But they cut their 2010 forecasts by 3 per cent to 60p on fears of a fall in non-cash pension interest. ABF shares jumped 28p, or 3.5 per cent, to 840p in early London trading.

The discount fashion retailer increased total sales in the period by 18 per cent, aided by new store openings. Primark did not detail the like-for-like figure, which strips out new stores, but analysts thought it could have at least matched the 4 per cent achieved in 2008. The shares firmed 3p to 678p as ABF said it expected full-year earnings to be little changed from last year's 54.9p a share on an adjusted basis. John Bason, finance director, said the Primark result was particularly pleasing as the chain had not followed other retailers in cutting prices sharply before Christmas. The chain's first store in the Netherlands, in Rotterdam, had performed ahead of expectations. He said the recent revelations in a BBC programme about poor employee conditions at one of its UK suppliers had already been picked up by the chain's independent auditors, and ""we're very upset about it"". Primark's own investigation was well under way, he said. Looking ahead, Mr Bason warned that the fall in the pound had ""to be a force for higher prices in clothing"", which would affect Primark in late spring or early summer. But he said spare capacity at some suppliers, as other retailers cut orders, and lower freight rates would provide some mitigation. Mr Bason said the impact on Primark of weaker sterling was more than offset by the benefit to the rest of the group from the pound's decline. Group sales in the 16-week period rose 21 per cent, but would have been 15 per cent higher on a constant currency basis. Aside from Primark, ABF said firmer than expected sugar prices in Europe and lower energy costs were helping its sugar division, where revenues rose 20 per cent. The grocery division increased revenue 21 per cent in spite of some consumers trading down. Sales growth of Twinings' premium teas slowed, while the Australian bakery business was affected by switching to own-label products. Profits from the UK bread business rose, in spite of the impact of Premier Foods' relaunch of its Hovis brand. In the US edible oils business, where ABF owns the Mazola brand, a sharp fall in oil prices led to a loss on the group's long position in commodity markets. which would weigh on first-half profits, Mr Bason said.

Sales from sugar, which comprised about 17 per cent of turn-over in 2009, jumped 23 per cent, helped by a more stable EU sugar market and a ""terrific"" sugar crop harvest. Warren Ackerman, analyst at Evolution Securities, said: ""It is the first time in many years that all three of ABF's largest divisions are firing on all cylinders at the same time."" The shares rose 10½p to close at 870p. AB Foods has put in a forecast-beating performance, sweetened by a more benign sugar market, and continued market share gains from Primark. The budget retailer will be a key driver of growth for the group, as it consolidates its position in the UK and takes advantage of expansion opportunities abroad. The shares have risen about 30 per cent in the past year, and trade on a forward price/earnings ratio of 14 times. That is a well-deserved premium to the retail sector, given Primark's superior growth prospects. 20100114_27936_414.xml"

ABF said it expected profit before goodwill, amortisation and exceptional items in the six months to February 27 to show a ""substantial increase"" on the £275m ($426m) reported in the corresponding period last year. It remained confident of ""good progress in earnings for the full year"". Underlying operating profit would also be well ahead of last year, with growth forecast to continue into the second half. Primark, one of the winners of the recession as thrifty shoppers snapped up its low-priced high fashion trends, delivered sales growth from stores open at least a year of 8 per cent in the first half in spite of the poor weather. ""It is more a story of the decade than the recession,"" said John Bason, finance director. ""We are in the right place for the consumer at the moment, both in terms of the merchandise and the value for money."" The chain received a boost from new stores, including 14 it has opened in Spain. ""Spain is going well ... We expect to expand further in Spain,"" said Mr Bason. Elsewhere, ABF said profit from its sugar division would be ""substantially ahead"" of the year-earlier period, driven by the performance in Europe, as changes to the European sugar regime are now behind it, together with a recovery in China. In the grocery division, there was some evidence of demand returning for Twinings Tea as consumers returned to more upmarket products. The ethnic food market was also stabilising after sales to Indian and Chinese restaurants were hit by households cutting back on takeaways. ""All of our divisions are performing well,"" said Mr Bason. ""We have been investing a lot in the group, which has not been an easy thing to do over the past couple of years of recession, and a lot of the things are bearing fruit now."" Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said the broker expected to increase its forecast of full-year pre-tax profit - after a £19m charge for a reorganisation at Twinings, but before a disposal gain of £24m - from £757m to £765m-£770m, on a better performance in the grocery division than expected. He estimated that ABF had invested about £5bn-£6bn in the group over the past five years. ""There was a need for them to deliver rising earnings and higher returns.

George Weston, chief executive, said the group, which makes Twinings teas, Ovaltine drinks and Ryvita biscuits, had noticed improvement in its overseas markets. ""We are seeing outside the UK quite a different world,"" Mr Weston said. Within the UK, he said ABF was selling more premium Twinings teas than last year, although it was unclear whether this was the result of a strong advertising campaign or a recovery in underlying appetite. Demand for foods used by Indian and Chinese restaurants also fell last year as households cut back on take-aways. Mr Weston said: ""We are now beginning perhaps to see growth back there"". He said that disruption from the ash cloud caused by the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption was ""inconvenient, rather than anything worse"". The comments came as ABF reported that pre-tax profits in the 24 weeks to February 27 rose from £178m to £320m, helped by a net £23m gain on the sale of its Polish sugar business, compared with a £60m charge last time from restructuring its US commodity oils arm. Stripping out exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, profit rose from £275m to £331m, ahead of expectations, sending the shares up 55½p to £10.14. Sales rose 10 per cent to £4.8bn. Primark, which has emerged as one of the winners from the recession as cash-strapped shoppers snap up its low-priced takes on high-end fashion, saw sales from stores open at least a year rise 8 per cent. Operating margin was maintained at 11.4 per cent, a better performance than expected as ABF benefited from a strengthening of sterling, compared with the year-earlier period, and a higher volume of sales, which spreads overheads, helping increase operating profit from £122m to £144m. The grocery division increased operating profit from £62m to £95m after a £19m charge for revamping Twinings, involving moving processing to Poland and China. The improvement reflected restructuring of the grocery division over the past couple of years. Credit Suisse raised its forecast of full-year pre-tax profit by £40m to £795m.

But thousands of miles away from the cheap and cheerful fashion of British high streets is the faster-growing engine of ABF's empire - Chinese sugar. Sugar, which makes up one-fifth of the UK conglomerate's revenues, saw operating profits jump 27 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, fuelled in part by operations in China. That compares with 5 per cent growth at Primark. Some analysts say this explains ABF's lagging share price, down some 18 per cent in the year to date. ""We are seeing a shift in terms of the components of profit growth from Primark to sugar,"" says Julian Hardwick, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. ""And the issue for the market is that the sugar business is an inherently much lower price/earnings multiple business because it is less predictable."" Predictability is certainly in short supply, particularly in China. The demand dynamics are encouraging - China's consumption per head is less than half the levels of neighbouring Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention Europe. But challenges loom large. Tony Cheung, a veteran of the consumer goods industry who now heads ABF's sugar operations in China, spends his time criss-crossing the country. His aim: recruiting farmers, increasing production, developing a supply chain for byproducts such as molasses - all the while keeping government onside. ""The challenge we have is to deal with over 300,000 farmers,"" he says. ""Each one owns a small piece of land and therefore doesn't have much machinery."" China grows two types of sugar: cane in the balmier south, beet in the colder north. Like many industries, it was previously state-owned and is now in the hands of local or foreign (usually Asian) companies, investors and local entrepreneurs. ABF's beet operations are concentrated in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, where the influence of neighbouring Russia can be seen in stark factories and where temperatures often drop below zero. Farms there are not only fragmented, but also under-productive. They produce less than 30 tonnes a hectare, says Mr Cheung, well below Europe's 70 tonnes. ""These are entrepreneur farmers rather than professional growers,"" says Mr Cheung. ""They have small pieces of land in a big geography or hilly terrain that rules out the use of big machines. They don't have the right knowledge about what fertiliser to use."" To tackle this, ABF's China Sugar unit borrows a ploy from The Archers, the long-running British radio soap opera that educates farmers while it entertains. Cheerful cartoon books give simple tips on planting and giveaways for farmers are emblazoned with words of encouragement and advice. A Lunar New Year banner roughly translates as: ""If you grow sugar beet for us in the year of the rabbit you will get more profit."" In a similar vein, China Sugar organises village gatherings. Farmers who meet their targets on beet production can claim a prize - cash, or perhaps a cow or a sheep - while the village is rewarded with help on irrigation systems or small machinery purchases. Almost 1,000 agricultural assistants roam the farms, sometimes resorting to text messages to relay help. In addition, the company has helped develop smaller machinery better suited to the scale of Chinese farms. It has cajoled government at a local and national level to provide subsidies. But for all the troubles, Chinese crops trump those of the UK - where ABF also has operations - in at least one respect. Volatile British weather last winter left frozen beets thawing out too quickly and rotting. But, smiles Mr Cheung, ""we don't have that problem in China because here it's always so cold"". UK conglomerate ABF educates, offers cash and rewards to farmers and develops machinery as it attempts to push China's fragmented local industry into the 21st century"

ABF has opted to take the hit on margins from rising cotton prices in order to drive volume at its retail arm - a strategy that seems to be working as Primark revenues rose 11 per cent, or 13 per cent on a constant currency basis, year-on-year to £1.4bn in the first half. Operating margins narrowed, however, from 11.4 per cent to 10.7 per cent. ""We expect to reduce margins further in the second half of the year,"" said George Weston, chief executive. ""This will reflect a full period of the value added tax increase [in the UK], higher cotton prices and the likelihood of continued weakness in UK consumer demand. This decision to invest in margin has been made against a backdrop of robust current and expected sales growth."" The shares dropped 61p to 984p. ""There has been a downgrading of expectations here, and it's really all around the Primark margins,"" said Julian Hardwick, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. Commodity inflation affected units across ABF's portfolio - including, on the flipside, in sugar where rising prices helped fuel a 27 per cent jump in operating profit to £108m. Overall, operating profit rose 6 per cent to £356m. Also bearing the brunt of higher raw material prices and weak consumer sentiment was Premier Foods, whose brands include Hovis and Mr Kipling. Premier's sales fell 2.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter in value terms and 7.1 per cent in volume terms. But the group - which has spent much of the past year de-leveraging - pointed to improvement in March when volumes, though still down 1.6 per cent, returned to 2010 levels. Raw material and packaging costs rose ""in the low teens"" year-on-year, the company said. Jim Smart, chief financial officer, said about 80 per cent of input inflation had been recovered via price rises, with another 20 per cent or so - representing cost increases subsequent to the reporting period - to implement. Premier's revenues fell 5.2 per cent to £574m year-on-year in the first quarter. Excluding businesses that have since been disposed of, revenues dropped 3.1 per cent - or 3.8 per cent in volume terms - to £474m. ABF's revenues for the 24 weeks to March 5 rose 9 per cent to £5.21bn. Net debt jumped from £816m to £1.36bn, following nearly £400m of net capital investment and bigger working capital outflows as a result of commodity inflation. Pre-tax profit was flat at £319m and earnings per share dropped 1p to 30.6p. The interim dividend rises 4 per cent to 7.9p"

The group also revealed that slightly fewer than 400 jobs were at risk in the UK, as it revamped its Twinings tea business, moving processing to Poland and China. George Weston, chief executive, said the group was cautious about prospects for the UK consumer. He said: ""With taxes going up and government spending going down, and unemployment still going up, it seems the most likely thing is consumer spending remains subdued."" Mr Weston expected it to be a ""long slog to recovery"", adding: ""I can't see there is going to be a great splurge at Christmas."" At Primark, which is expanding in Europe, like-for-like sales rose 7 per cent in the year to September 12, with overall sales up 20 per cent. Mr Weston said current trading continued to go well but the recent warm weather had affected demand for coats and sweaters. Primark's operating profit margin fell from 12.1 per cent to 10.9 per cent because of an increase in overheads from a new distribution centre and the drop in sterling. Primark helped ABF lift sales from £8.24bn to £9.26bn. But group pre-tax profit fell from £527m to £495m, reflecting the closure of a factory as part of the merger of the North American edible oils business with Archer Daniels Midland, and higher financing costs. The group benefited, however, from a ""real turning point"" in its sugar business. Nevertheless, ABF, which employs 32,500 in the UK, is in consultations about closing a factory in Newcastle, employing 260 people, while another 130 jobs in Andover, Hampshire, are under threat. Twinings' processing for export markets will move to a factory in China, which will be doubled in size, and to a new factory in Poland.

Earlier this year ABF issued what it called an ""uncharacteristically bold"" forecast for full-year earnings - despite continued pressure on consumer spending - on the back of higher prices for sugar and lower prices for cotton. But on Monday In a trading statement ahead of its full-year results to mid-September the company flagged a £100m non-cash charge ""for the impairment of property, plant and equipment at the meat factory"" in Australia. However, ABF said adjusted operating profit for the second half ""will be substantially ahead of last year"" and in line with market expectations after a strong performance from the group's sugar division. It said that net debt was expected to be below £1.2bn from £1.3bn last year despite the purchase of Elephant Atta earlier this year. In July ABF paid £34m in cash for Elephant Atta, a flour brand used to make unleavened breads such as naan and chapatti, from Premier Foods. The company said sugar revenues in the second half were ""well ahead"" of last year reflecting strong prices in Europe and Africa. That's despite the company writing off a £15m investment in Mali due to political turmoil in the west African country. ABF said the amount would be mostly recouped by profits made on the disposal of its sugar operations in Poland. In the first half ABF's sugar division reported a 59 per cent rise in operating profit to £172m on revenue that was up 17 per cent to £1.2bn. That helped offset restructuring costs which hit ABF's grocery business, which owns brands including Twinings, Ovaltine and Kingsmill. The company said its EU division produced 1.3m tonnes of sugar compared with 1m last year. The group had earlier warned that consumer demand would be under pressure in the eurozone, which accounts for about 20 per cent of its sales. Primark, the low-cost fashion chain, which opened 19 stores during the year to bring its total to 242 stores, had achieved 3 per cent like-for-like sales growth driven by strong UK shopping over the summer. ABF said trading on the continent had been ""buoyant"". ABF also said Primark's second-half operating margins would be higher, reflecting lower cotton prices during the period. Earlier this year the company chose not to pass on cotton increases to budget-conscious consumers."

However, shares in parent company Associated British Foods fell nearly 5 per cent on Monday as it revealed sales growth at the budget retailer had slowed in its final quarter as its sugar business suffered from an ""unsustainably low"" world sugar price. John Bason, ABF's finance director, said negotiations had started to find 10 Primark stores ""in major metro areas in the corridor from Baltimore to Boston"", and to source new suppliers in Central America capable of producing the fast-turnround fashion pieces that the retailer is famous for. ""We've approached the US market carefully,"" Mr Bason said. ""The reason we've chosen the northeast is because [consumers'] fashion choices are more European-looking."" In a nod to British retailers including Tesco and Marks and Spencer who have failed to succeed in America, he added: ""Concentrating on one area and getting it right makes a lot of sense to us."" The bulk of Primark's clothes are manufactured in Asia, although the retailer uses factories in Turkey and eastern Europe to produce faster-selling lines for its European stores. Mr Bason said the group was seeking suppliers in Mexico and Guatemala to replicate this ability in the US. It has already signed a lease to open a large store in Boston, but Mr Bason said there were no plans to follow Top Shop and open in Manhattan, although it was targeting the wider ""metro area of New York state"". The discount retailer, which first announced plans to enter the US in April, detailed its push into the market in a pre-close trading update on Monday. ABF said Primark's annual like-for-like sales growth would be 4.5 per cent for the year to September 13. However, this was half a percentage point lower than some analysts were expecting, based on assumptions about market share gleaned from recent industry data from Kantar Worldpanel. Although the retailer's like-for-like sales rose 8 per cent in the third quarter, analysts calculated that this rate had slowed to just 3 per cent in the final quarter, missing market expectations of a 4 per cent rise. However, ABF said that less discounting in the final 13 weeks of trading meant these sales were more profitable, and that the full-year operating margin would exceed the 13.1 per cent achieved in the first half. Analysts calculated that Primark would produce £600m of operating profits on a turnover of £5bn, and expect the retailer to account for more than half of profits at ABF's annual results in early November. Mr Bason said like-for-like sales in Spain, where it has 40 stores, were up by 10 per cent and that sales densities in its 13 German stores were ""much higher"" than the UK as shoppers were travelling longer distances to visit stores, and spending more money per visit. When asked what would set Primark apart from its US rivals, Mr Bason replied: ""People don't see Primark as trading down. They see it as a normal way to shop."" Stacey Widlitz, an analyst at SW Retail Advisors in New York, said: ""If the UK is any lesson, US retailers now have even more reason to be looking over their shoulder."" She believed Primark's entry into the US market was ""a real threat to the teen [fashion] space in the US"" due to its combination of fashionable clothes and rock-bottom prices. ""With a limited wallet size, teens are getting smarter about allocating their spending on inexpensive basics in order to save up for a fashion splurge,"" she said. ""And don't forget the 'fashion splurges' are increasingly migrating to new fast fashion arrivals H&M, Topshop and Zara. Seems like US retailers might feel the walls are starting to close in - any retailer in the basics business in the US should be warned."" ""People said that there was no way Primark would succeed in Germany and Spain - but they have,"" said Nick Bubb, the independent retail analyst. ""Their record says they are entitled to be confident in the US, but the problem is there's so much more competition from the likes of Kmart, Target and even Walmart."" After the opening in downtown Boston scheduled for late 2015, Mr Bubb questioned whether Primark's subsequent stores would be in city centres, mirroring fellow British entrant Top Shop, or in out-of-town malls, which the US discounters tended to favour. ""What Primark offers is fashion at a crazy low price,"" he said. ""Their gross margin is much lower, yet their merchandise and store designs are as good as you can get. It's been a winning combination in the UK and Europe, and could be in America in due course."" Alan Erskine, analyst at UBS, shared confidence in Primark's ability to succeed where other British retailers had failed in cracking the US market. ""When you think about it, it isn't such a big leap into the unknown,"" he said. ""They're competing against brands they already compete against in Europe such as Inditex, H&M and Forever 21. Sourcing will not require a big logistical shift, as the Primark ships from China will dock in Boston instead of Southampton. They're going in capital light, as the US stores and warehouses will be leased, not owned."" ------------------------------------------- ABF's sugar business not so sweet Primark's strong performance took the edge off declining profits at ABF's sugar business. The company confirmed in a pre-close trading statement on Monday that revenue and adjusted operating profit for AB Sugar would be ""substantially lower"" than last year. The segment continued to suffer from the ""unsustainably low"" world sugar price, which at 17 cents a pound is ""well below the global average cost of production"". Operating profits in ABF's sugar business peaked at £500m in 2012, but Credit Suisse has pencilled in just £95m in the full year to 2015 as the European market, where ABF produces most of its crop, undergoes extensive structural change. On Monday, ABF said the strong pound would knock a further £20m from operating profits in its sugar business. ""The current world and European prices of sugar mean that only the most efficient companies will be making any money next year,"" said Charlie Mills, consumer analyst at Credit Suisse. European prices have been driven down by more than a fifth in the past year as competing producers position for growth in new markets ahead of the removal of EU quotas in October 2017. This shake-up of the EU's sugar regime has already caused several to exit the market, and more are expected to do so post-2017. Mr Mills said the latest EU price for refined sugar was €562 a tonne, measured in June, compared with 722 a tonne a year previously, and that sugar was increasingly being contracted at levels ""lower than that"". ""As a working assumption, by June 2015 it will be down to under €500 per tonne we believe, which is pretty painful for the sugar producers,"" he said. John Bason, ABF's finance director, said: ""I think that in the EU in 2015 we're looking at lower prices again."" AB Sugar has responded by reducing its overheads in the current trading year. It previously announced a £20m charge to provide for further cost cutting as it chases further efficiency gains while the market remains less than sweet."

You can sign up for FT Opening Quote . Bill Winters, who co-owns a theatre in West London, has hoisted the curtain on a turbulent First Act in his incumbency as chief executive of Standard Chartered. He is cutting 15,000 jobs, raising £3.3bn through a rights issue and reviewing one-third of the group's risk-weighted assets. Mr Winters is right to generate some shock and awe. Standard Chartered's results have been poor having expanded into Asian corporate lending at the top of the commodities cycle. The group made a $140m loss in the third quarter compared with a $1.5bn profit last time, though that reflects the heavy writeoffs characteristic of a new broom CEO. Whether the ex-JPMorgan executive's performance will, in time, be hailed as a coup de theatre, depends largely on the health of Asian economies and the success with which Standard Chartered builds up its retail operation. The wee small hours yielded a couple of tech deals as well as news of the Standard Chartered restructuring. US games group Activision Blizzard is buying King Digital, UK-based owner of Candy Crush, a diversion for bored commuters, for $5.9bn. Activision is paying less than King Digital listed for in New York, after deciding UK investors would not pay enough for its float. Swedish private equity group EQT is selling UK luxury phones maker Vertu to Godin Holdings of Hong Kong for a mystery price. Cynics claim that some Vertu owners carry the phones for bling purposes, but generally tote a backup model made by someone else for added functionality. Corporate activity during UK hours of darkness have put the stock exchange's 7am data dump in the shade. News from that source includes full-year results from fast fashion-to-root vegetables combine Associated British Foods. These are roughly in line with forecasts, featuring sales flat at £12.8bn and adjusted operating profits 4 per cent weaker at some £1.1bn. The decline reflected food price deflation in the sugars business, in contrast to the growing Primark clothes retailing operation. This recorded a 5 per cent increase in operating profits at constant currencies. Towards the end of the financial year, Primark opened a US store in the refurbished Filene's department store building, a Boston landmark. National Grid chief executive Steve Holliday is to retire in 2016. Some pessimists have predicted the lights will go out in the UK later this decade due to dwindling generation capacity, so Mr Holliday might just avoid that embarrassing moment.

George Weston, chief executive of the family-controlled group, said of Primark’s first US store in Boston, which opened in September: “The prices have amazed people and it’s trading well. But it’s only one store and it has only been trading for eight weeks, which is why we did not comment on it [in our results].” The FTSE 100 retail and food conglomerate said on Tuesday that ABF would stick to its investment plans “most notably for Primark”, despite reporting annual results that were hit by falling food prices, especially of sugar, and unfavourable currency movements. The fast-growing Primark chain, which contributes 60 per cent of operating profits, will receive the lion’s share of group capital expenditure this year, of £400m — up from £306m last year. This will fund new store openings, which will add a total of 1.5m sq ft, up from last year’s 1m sq ft of added capacity, in Europe and the US. Primark’s operating profits rose 2 per cent to £673m on sales that were 8 per cent higher. Its operating profit margin, however, contracted from 13.4 per cent to 12.6 per cent. Same-store sales rose 1 per cent, prompting Nick Bubb, an independent analyst, to comment: “Mighty Primark doesn’t look to have been in such good form over the last year.” But Mr Weston said this reflected the level of discounting returning to normal levels following an exceptionally strong year in 2013-2014. Primark sources most of its clothes in dollars but sells mostly in sterling and euros. The group said the retailer’s profits would be hit this year by the continued strength of the dollar, and that the unfavourable currency impact would lead to a “modest” fall in adjusted operating profit and earnings per share. Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein, said: “We expected management to be cautious on 2016 . . . but not as cautious as to indicate slightly lower adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings. If guidance turns out to be correct, this will mean two consecutive years of flat or negative EPS growth.” Pre-tax profits dropped 30 per cent to £717m in the year to September 30, on sales down 1 per cent at £12.8bn. The headline number was dragged down by £270m of one-off costs incurred in cutting costs in the sugar business, which has seen its profits dissolve in the face of a sharp fall in prices in recent years. Stripping out these exceptionals, adjusted profit fell 6 per cent, or 4 per cent at constant currencies. Adjusted earnings per share fell 2 per cent to 102p. Sugar operating profits fell 77 per cent to £43m and the unit now accounts for just 2 per cent of group profits, leaving ABF reliant on Primark and its grocery business — which includes Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine drinks — for 88 per cent of profits. Grocery operating profits increased 6 per cent to £285m while the ingredients division reported a 78 per cent rise in profits to £76m. The shares, which have climbed 28 per cent over the past 12 months, were slightly lower in mid-afternoon London trading at £34.19."

The group made a $140m loss in the third quarter compared with a $1.5bn profit last time, though that reflects the heavy writeoffs characteristic of a new broom CEO. Whether the ex-JPMorgan executive’s performance will, in time, be hailed as a coup de theatre, depends largely on the health of Asian economies and the success with which Standard Chartered builds up its retail operation.

"Factiva-20230329-1502 (4).rtf","Document FTCOM00020151108ebb8001gu","8 November 2015","Diversity is the spice of life for Associated British Foods","816 words","Associated British Foods sets a bad example for impressionable younger businesses. The 80-year-old company breaks many of the rules for good corporate management held dear in the UK, where it is listed. The group exemplifies diversification of an extreme kind, combining fast fashion chain Primark with, among other things, a sugar business dependent on harvesting root vegetables from the chilly soil of Norfolk. Moreover, the company is controlled by a charitable trust and is run by a hereditary chief executive, George Weston. This oddity might be shrugged off in the permissive US or continental Europe. In the starchy City of London, such things simply are not done. Gallingly for corporate governance fundamentalists, ABF has performed a lot better than many of the businesses they approve of. The growing reach of Primark has been marked by recent flagship store openings in Boston and Madrid. The shares have generated a 166 per cent total shareholder return over three years according to S&P CIQ, to build a market capitalisation of £27bn. But when it released annual results last week, they were disappointing, with profits before tax 30 per cent lower at £717m. Surely this was evidence that extreme diversification does not work? Profits from the sugar business crashed. Primark made modest gains against tough comparatives. A big, but low-profile groceries business lifted earnings 6 per cent. When divisions are so disparate both operationally and in performance, why combine them in a single group? One answer may be found in the sanguine reaction of investors to the admittedly well-flagged numbers. The shares closed flat on the week. Diversification tends to damp earnings volatility, and with it, share price gyrations. That reduces the exposure of businesses to short-term crises, real or imagined, making it easier for them to pursue long-term strategies. ’s most closely-watched work in progress and analysts now talk of it in the same breath as Hennes & Mauritz of Sweden and Inditex of Spain. The difference is that its prices are typically 50 per cent lower according to research by Jefferies, a broker. Most of its garments are made in Bangladesh, the supply chain is lean and sales densities in stores are high. It is a maverick in that it advertises very little and sells nothing online, but more conventionally it hopes to follow H&M and Inditex into the US market. The boss of another big fashion business says Mr Weston would have been better advised to expand into developing markets where competition is less intense. If Mr Weston fails in the US, at least he will do so in style. Primark’s first American shop is in a landmark Bostonian building once occupied by Filene’s department store, famed, appropriately enough, for its bargain basement. ABF has partly funded Primark using cash flow from sugar, groceries and other divisions. Without this support, it is unlikely adjusted operating profits would have doubled over five years to £673m. Bulls such as Citi believe the business is teetering on the cusp of greatness as a multinational retailer. Some investors would promote the idea of splitting Primark and ABF’s food businesses were it not for the blocking stake held by the trust and the Weston family. The steep 34 times forward earnings ratio carried by ABF shares is reflective of optimism concerning Primark. On its own, the division would boast a multiple closer to 40 times. Focus is the mantra of the UK market for the justifiable reason that some historic conglomerates, notably GEC, became staid and sluggish. But the prejudice against these multi-strand ventures ignores the capacity of mature businesses to support newer ones within the same corporate wrapper. ABF is not the only exponent. Whitbread, an erstwhile leisure conglomerate, now combines the Premier Inn hotels business with the fast-growing Costa coffee shop chain. This has given Starbucks a run for its money in the UK. The grubbier reason the City likes focus is that it generates more fees. If chief executives build companies with inbuilt buffers against risk, investment managers have less work to do in creating balanced portfolios. Internal funding generates no lending margins for banks. Volatile single-bet businesses have volatile shares. These swell commissions for brokers. Objections from financial professionals to diversified businesses would be more convincing — if their own sector was not littered with them. Private equity companies are among the modern incarnations of conglomerates. Another is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group which occupies third place in Fortune magazine’s of most admired companies, the authority of which is just a little diluted by the inclusion of VW. If Mr Weston should be rebuked for spreading his eggs across multiple baskets, so must Mr Buffett."
"Factiva-20230329-1502.rtf","Document FTCOM00020120119e81j003ml","19 January 2012","Strong Primark sales boost ABF","517 words","Shoppers' desire for cheap clothes and a buoyant sugar price kept the tills ringing at Associated British Foods, even as rival high street retailers were left reeling by consumers' thriftiness. A 16 per cent increase in sales at Primark, ABF's discount retailer, helped drive a 12 per cent jump in revenues for the group in the 16 weeks to January 7. Stripping out new stores - and the group is increasing its footprint by some 10 per cent a year - like-for-like sales grew 2-3 per cent, on analysts' estimates. ""We had a slow autumn because it was warm,"" said John Bason, finance director. ""But we had a really strong Christmas trading period, particularly in the UK."" Some have attributed Primark's gain to others' pain, such as that of Barratt and Peacocks, which have collapsed into administration. But other analysts, noting that the latter's issues were more to do with debt, rather point to the retailer's value for money offerings which chime with cash-strapped consumers. While ABF's interim management statement showed strong top-line growth - ingredients, up 2 per cent year-on-year in the 16 week period, was the weakest segment - analysts and ABF itself cautioned that it was not yet clear how much would drop down to the bottom line. ABF took the hit when cotton prices soared last year, so margins could benefit now that prices have fallen sharply from the peaks. Because of this, the company has been guiding towards a stronger second half. Alicia Forry, analyst at Collins Stewart, noted that operating margins were likely to be lower in the first half as a result of cotton prices and ramped-up promotions. ""We have to wait and see if they have outpaced on the top line, but when it comes to results and profits delivered [whether] they deliver less profit than their peers,"" she said. ABF, like its peers, could instead opt to pass the cheaper prices directly onto consumers in order to support sales growth. However, Ms Forry sees sales growth as sustainable given the popularity of new stores in Germany and Spain - stores outside the UK now contribute one-third of Primark's turnover - and an offering that is popular with today's thriftier consumers. Mr Bason said that, despite the ""torrid"" economic climate, Spanish shoppers were flocking to the value clothing market. The Spanish market ""is probably where the UK was 10-15 years ago"", he said. Grocery, the third leg of ABF, was a more mixed bag. The company continues to struggle in Australia, where private-label goods provide strong competition to branded manufacturers. Kingsmill bread, like other British bakeries, also saw its margins eroded by high levels of competition, ABF said. The three main bakers - the other two are Premier Foods' Hovis and privately owned Warburtons - are battling it out in a declining market, which is further dampened by heavy logistics and distribution costs. Shares in ABF were up 2.1 per cent to £11.61 in morning trading."
"Factiva-20230329-1502.rtf","Document FTCOM00020120119e81j002e5","19 January 2012","'Exceptional' Primark sales boost ABF","441 words","Associated British Foods on Thursday said its sugar operations and Primark clothing store chain had delivered ""exceptional"" sales over the autumn and early winter, although commodity prices continued to have a mixed impact on profit. The conglomerate, a member of the FTSE 100 index of leading UK-listed companies, said sales in the 16 weeks to January 7 were 12 per cent ahead of the same period a year earlier. The increase was 21 per cent at its sugar arm, where ABF said UK production for the year was estimated to be 1.25m tonnes, compared with 1m tonnes in the previous year, when the crop was hit by extreme December weather. High sugar prices would help to result in ""strong profit delivery"" by the UK sugar business over the current financial year, which ends in mid-September, it added. The group was also upbeat about its Spanish sugar operations, although the picture was more mixed at its Illovo arm, Africa's biggest sugar producer, and its Chinese sugar business. Primark's sales during the period were up 16 per cent year-on-year, reflecting ""particularly strong trading over the Christmas period after a slower start to the financial year as a result of the unusually warm autumn"". The growth, which compares with a 13 per cent increase during the last financial year, was fuelled by 9 new store openings during the period, including three in Germany and two in Spain. John Bason, ABF finance director, said: ""The Primark sales growth is an acceleration - 16 per cent sales growth is a stand-out."" He added: ""The Primark concept is becoming very well established on a pan-European basis."" It did not give a figure for Primark's like-for-like sales, which strips out the effect of new store openings, although it said like-for-like growth was ""good"". Primark's operating profit margin continued to be hit by higher cotton costs, which the chain had decided not to pass on to its customers, although it said it would begin to see the benefit of lower cotton prices in its second half figures. Sales growth was a more muted 4 per cent in ABF's grocery arm, which includes Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ryvita crispbreads. Martin Deboo, an analyst at Investec Securities, said ABF's performance overall was ""decent"". However, the likelihood of stronger-than-forecast sugar profits would be offset by difficulties with a new Australian meat factory. ABF shares, which have been strong performers since mid-August, rose 1p to £11.38 in early morning trading in London on Thursday."
"Factiva-20230329-1503 (1).rtf","Document FTCOM00020170419ed4j0030d","19 April 2017","Sugar lifts first-half profits at Primark owner ABF","616 words","The baton of profits growth at passed from low-cost retail chain Primark to sugar in the first half of the year, as the FTSE 100 company reported a near-doubling of pre-tax earnings. Each of the conglomerate’s five main businesses, especially ingredients and its Twinings Ovaltine grocery unit, contributed to better than expected results on Wednesday. The Weston family-controlled group upgraded its full-year forecast to “good growth” in earnings per share from “progress” previously. ABF makes two-thirds of its sales and profits outside the UK, and the fall in sterling since June’s Brexit vote, boosted first-half operating profits by £51m. George Weston, chief executive, said that ABF had been in talks with the government about the implications for the food industry of Brexit. The company has set up a dedicated team to determine the consequences on its operations of leaving the EU. “The food supply chain is larger than the aerospace and automotive industries combined, and that has come as a surprise to some people in government,” said Mr Weston. “I think we have got our message across.” He was speaking as ABF reported a 41-fold leap in sugar profits to £123m in the 24 weeks to March 4, from £3m in the same period last year, which Mr Weston attributed to “higher prices and hard work”. EU sugar prices have risen 13 per cent over the past year but the improvement at its AB Sugar subsidiary mainly reflects years of cost-cutting and restructuring that has led to the sale of some lossmaking operations in China in favour of expansion in Africa. ABF shares rose as much as 4 per cent on Wednesday before falling back to sit 1.3 per cent higher at £27.53 at the close. But its stock is 20 per cent lower than a year ago on concerns about profitability at Primark, ABF’s biggest business by sales and earnings. Primark operating profits of £323m were 3 per cent higher than the first half last year, but 2 per cent lower at constant exchange rates. The strength of the dollar hit Primark, which buys its clothes in dollars but makes most of its sales in the UK. That led to a squeeze on operating profit margins, which fell to 10 per cent in the first half, from 11.7 per cent previously. Analysts expect Primark’s margins to fall further, to 9.6 per cent by the end of the year. Like-for-like sales at Primark were flat but revenues of £3.2bn were 21 per cent higher, or 11 per cent at constant exchange rates, thanks to 16 new store openings, including in the UK, the US, Italy and the Netherlands. The 1.5m sq ft of additional selling space this year marks the chain’s biggest expansion in a decade. It traded from 12.3m sq ft at the end of the last financial year. Group pre-tax profits rose 92 per cent to £867m, boosted by £255m of profits from disposals, mainly the sale of ABF’s US herbs and spice business. Revenues increased 19 per cent to £7.3bn. Adjusting for the exceptional gain, pre-tax profits were 35 per cent higher at £624m. Adjusted operating profits of £652m were 36 per cent higher in reported terms, or 23 per cent at constant currencies. Analysts at Citigroup said that the results were “ahead of our expectations driven by small beats in every division. ABF has delivered on the expected ‘excellent progress’ in first-half adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS.”"

In reality, Associated British Foods, which combines frock-seller Primark with sugar producers in Europe and Africa, has beaten the FTSE 100 by 79 per cent over five years. Pressure on margins in the fast fashion business now poses a sterner test to group profitability than diversification ever did. Over the past year ABF’s outperformance has come to an abrupt end. A weaker pound has led to worries about rising US dollar input costs in clothes. Interim results on Wednesday did little to dispel such concern, despite sterling’s recent rally: chairman Charles Sinclair warned of “tempered” profit growth in the second half because of negative currency effects. Adjusted headline earnings rose by nearly a third. But operating profits in retail, which accounts for half of the total, slipped 2 per cent in constant currencies as margins contracted. Primark is not alone: rivals Inditex and H&M have also seen operating margins decline. A dependence on footfall, rather than online clicks, is particular to Primark. Like peers, Primark hopes to absorb margin pressures by growing volumes. Spain has blossomed into Primark’s second-biggest market from nearly nothing more than a decade ago. wants to repeat the trick in the Netherlands, Italy and France: European continental store space grew by one-fifth. A recovery in beet sugar, where operating profits jumped from very little to £123m, should also pick up some of the earnings slack. The end of a drought in Southern Africa and a buyout of minorities in low-cost producer Illovo means greater operational gearing. Investors are less excited by root vegetables than retail. Most of ABF’s operating profit growth — averaging 5 per cent since 2012 — has come from Primark. The fashion is still fast, but the returns will be slower from now on.

At an operating level, some £51m of the £171m increase in profit was entirely due to the currency effect that had so squeezed Primark. Chief executive George Weston said: We achieved a more acceptable rate of return in Sugar and further good progress was made by our Ingredients and Grocery businesses. But investors should remember finance director John Bason recently pointed out that almost all the group’s profits increase would come in the first half, thanks to stronger sugar performance – and ABF shares have fallen by 23 per cent over the past 12 months because of concerns about currency at Primark, which is still 60 per cent of the business.

Burberry reported notched up a 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in its first half, or 19 per cent including the exchange rate boost, thanks to strong sales in the UK and a return to growth in China. Retail revenues reached £1.3bn in the six months to March 31, but total revenues were down 1 per cent, partly due to a decision to scrap its own perfume and beauty range and enter a new franchised fragrance arrangement with Coty. Think “smell of damp raincoat”. Among the strongest sellers in period were accessories, where Burberry achieved a double digit rise in leather goods revenues. Chinese sales rose in the “high single digits” but fell in Hong Kong and Korea. Christopher Bailey, still chief executive until Marco Gobbetti takes over in the summer, said: The outperformance of fashion and the strong customer response to new products underline our renewed creative momentum. And while on the subject of getting rid of unwanted smells… pest control and hygiene group Rentokil Initial has reported a 10 per cent increase in revenue as it continues its acquisition spree. Of that double digit rise, 3 per cent was organic growth and 7 per cent from acquisitions. In the past year, the group has bought up 12 businesses, ten in pest control, one in hygiene and one in property care, principally in emerging and growth markets. Combined annualised revenues of the businesses acquired totalled £101.7m in the 12 months immediately prior to acquisition. As a result, Rentokil’s pest control sales grew by 19 per cent, or which 6 per cent was organic, while hygiene revenues rose by 4 per cent, with 3 per cent organic. Emerging markets performed best, with sales up a quarter, and there was continuing strong performance from Asia, Pacific, Latin America, the UK and Rentokil’s largest market, North America. And, finally, Henderson Global Investors has reported a rise in asset management despite outflows from its funds in the opening months of this year. The investment house, which is in the with US rival Janus Capital, said it suffered a net outflow of £1.4bn from its retail clients, and £400m from institutional clients in the quarter ending in March. However, stronger investment performance and help from exchange rates helped assets under management to rise by just over £2bn, to £103.1bn. Andrew Formica, Chief Executive of Henderson, said: While Retail client outflows continued, we saw an improvement in client sentiment and flows as we moved towards the end of the quarter.

Burberry reported notched up a 3 per cent rise in like for like sales in its first half, or 19 per cent including the exchange rate boost, thanks to strong sales in the UK and a return to growth in China. Retail revenues reached £1.3bn in the six months to March 31, but total revenues were down 1 per cent, partly due to a decision to scrap its own perfume and beauty range and enter a new franchised fragrance arrangement with Coty. Think “smell of damp raincoat”. Among the strongest sellers in period were accessories, where Burberry achieved a double digit rise in leather goods revenues. Chinese sales rose in the “high single digits” but fell in Hong Kong and Korea. Christopher Bailey, still chief executive until Marco Gobbetti takes over in the summer, said: The outperformance of fashion and the strong customer response to new products underline our renewed creative momentum. And while on the subject of getting rid of unwanted smells… pest control and hygiene group Rentokil Initial has reported a 10 per cent increase in revenue as it continues its acquisition spree. Of that double digit rise, 3 per cent was organic growth and 7 per cent from acquisitions. In the past year, the group has bought up 12 businesses, 10 in pest control, one in hygiene and one in property care, principally in emerging and growth markets. Combined annualised revenues of the businesses acquired totalled £101.7m in the 12 months immediately prior to acquisition. As a result, Rentokil’s pest control sales grew by 19 per cent, or which 6 per cent was organic, while hygiene revenues rose by 4 per cent, with 3 per cent organic. Emerging markets performed best, with sales up a quarter, and there was continuing strong performance from Asia, Pacific, Latin America, the UK and Rentokil’s largest market, North America. And, finally, Henderson Global Investors has reported a rise in asset management despite outflows from its funds in the opening months of this year. The investment house, which is in the with US rival Janus Capital, said it suffered a net outflow of £1.4bn from its retail clients, and £400m from institutional clients in the quarter ending in March. However, stronger investment performance and help from exchange rates helped assets under management to rise by just over £2bn, to £103.1bn. Andrew Formica, Chief Executive of Henderson, said: While Retail client outflows continued, we saw an improvement in client sentiment and flows as we moved towards the end of the quarter.

But it warns that the pace of profits growth is unlikely to last. In its interim results today, the owner of Primark said overall pre-tax profits for the period were £867m, up by 92 per cent on the same time last year. That was boosted by the sale of some businesses, but adjusted profits were also up by 36 per cent, flattered somewhat by exchange rate movements. Revenues, at £7.3bn, were up by nearly a fifth. In a statement, the company said: The growth in earnings achieved in the first half has been excellent. We expect the underlying revenue momentum in all of our businesses to continue in the second half. However, profit growth in the second half will, at current exchange rates, be tempered primarily by a smaller translation benefit and the full effect of the devaluation of sterling against the US dollar on Primark’s margin. Discount retailer Primark has been stung by the drop in the pound since the UK’s vote to leave the EU. The shop chain buys most of its products in dollars, but makes more than half of its sales in the UK. But it has been performing strongly there; like-for-like sales were up by 2 per cent, with overall sales up by 7 per cent.

"Factiva-20230329-1503 (2).rtf","Document FTCOM00020170911ed9b004s9","11 September 2017","Strong summer sales boost Primark","818 words","Fewer discounts over the summer at Primark, the fast-fashion chain, led to an upbeat trading statement from Associated British Foods, the retailer’s parent company on Monday. The outlook for Primark’s profitability has improved towards the end of the group’s financial year on September 30. In Monday’s statement, the last update ahead of its full-year announcement in November, said it expected the retailer’s operating profit margins to end up higher in the second half of the year than the 10 per cent margin made in the first half. Previously, it had expected a 2 percentage point drop in Primark’s margins from last year’s 11.7 per cent, because of the impact of the weak pound against the dollar. But strong summer sales meant Primark had not had to resort to heavy discounting. ABF, which is controlled by the billionaire Weston family, also said it had acquired Acetum, a producer of Balsamic vinegar from Modena, Italy. The price was not given but the brand had revenues of €103m last year; ABF said it planned to expand internationally in speciality foods. John Bason, finance director, said: “This is a lovely business — right on consumer trend with high quality and great provenance.” The FTSE 100 conglomerate owns a variety of food businesses, including sugar production, alongside Primark, although the retailer accounts for 62 per cent of its operating profits. ABF stuck to its expectation of “good” growth in group profits this year. Primark, which buys most of its products in dollars but makes 55 per cent of its sales in the UK, was hit by sterling’s fall after the UK voted last year to leave the EU. It did not want to recoup the higher costs through price increases because it preferred to keep the lowest prices on the high street. It said the improvement in margins was driven by “favourable weather in the fourth quarter and the strength of our consumer offering [which] resulted in markdowns at lower levels than normal.” Hot sellers this summer included £10 inflatable pink flamingo lilos and Beauty and the Beast themed clothing. “We’ve got the stuff people want to buy,” said Mr Bason. He added that as inflation was beginning to bite the UK consumer, “value is the key — not trading down”. Like-for-like sales will end the year 1 per cent higher — they fell 2 per cent last year — while early trading of the autumn range was “encouraging”. Primark’s full year sales would be 13 per cent higher than last year, at constant currencies, and 20 per cent higher at actual rates. Analysts at Citi said: “We would expect the better outlook in Primark to drive at least 1 per cent upgrade to current consensus forecasts.” The 345-store chain will continue to expand next year with 1.2m sq ft of new space planned against 1.5m sq ft this year. It opened 30 stores this year — including three in the US, where it now has eight stores after its 2015 entry into the country — and plans another 19 next year. Honor Strachan, retail analyst at GlobalData, said on Monday: “Primark’s success, largely driven by the addition of 11 new stores in the UK and added an additional 40 per cent space at its Oxford Street East flagship, comes at the expense of the midmarket. “Its value credentials, broadened offer and improved store experience have allowed it to acquire new customers who are frustrated with stale ranges and dated stores across the likes of M&S, Arcadia and Debenhams — or whose budgets are squeezed and are satisfied with the product quality and choice at Primark.” In other parts of the business, ABF said grocery revenues would be flat compared with last year and adjusted profits would be lower because of a squeeze on margins at its Kingsmill bakery business, which has been hit by a price war in the UK bread market. The sugar business is on track for a sharp rebound in revenues and profits, although the ending of EU sugar quotas and oversupply meant that: “2017/18, EU sugar prices will be below those achieved in the current year.” ABF makes two-thirds of its operating profits outside the UK and will benefit from a £85m translation gain this year. It expected no significant translational gains or losses next year, although last year’s depreciation of sterling would continue to put pressure on Primark in the first half of 2017/18, but would benefit sugar profits. Warren Ackerman, analyst at Société Générale said: “ABF’s share price has risen by 10 per cent since its strong third-quarter results. Our initial view is that there are positives and negatives in today’s statement.” The shares were 2 per cent lower in early London trading at £31.96."

In a pre-close trading update released this morning, ABF said its profit outlook had since July, driven by rapid sales growth at its Primark chain which had struggled last year. Analysts at Credit Suisse lifted their profit forecasts for this year and next in response to the update, describing it as “overall a reassuring statement”. However, they suggested some other analysts had been “rather more optimistic” about the prospects for margin improvements in the new year, leading to disappointment today. ABF has benefited in recent months as the dollar has weakened, reducing cost pressures on some of its businesses after higher wages and sterling-induced inflation drove up costs earlier this year. That had led some analysts to predict that profit margins could improve going in to 2018, but the company said today “we expect full year margins to be similar to this year”. Shares in the company were down 2.7 per cent at publication time, to £31.77, but are still up more than 15 per cent for the year to date."

There is a lot to be said for some cheap and cheerful new clothes, a nice cup of tea, plenty of sugar and a hot buttered crumpet when inflation keeps outstripping wage growth, consumers are abandoning the high street, the prime minister has to deny she’s a robot live on BBC Radio’s Test Match Special, and Tony Blair – of all people – is starting to sound like the most rational politician on Brexit. So this morning’s news of even higher than forecast operating profit from the FTSE 100 owner of Primark, Twinings, Silver Spoon and Sunblest provided some much needed cheer. Although Brexit induced inflation has done little to help its customers or its costs, ABF has some protection with 60 per cent of sales coming from outside of the UK. In the 40 weeks to 24 June, the group had reported revenue growth of 20 per cent, with currency accounting for half of it. Today, ABF said full-year sales at Primark are expected to be 13 per cent ahead of last year on a constant currency basis driven by increased retail selling space and 1 per cent growth in like-for-like sales. On the same comparable basis but at actual exchange rates, sales are expected to be 20 per cent ahead. Primark has performed particularly well in the UK where full year sales are expected to be 10 per cent ahead of last year on a comparable basis, as the discount clothes store’s market share “has increased significantly”. ABF’s revenue and profit from sugar will also be “well ahead of last year” on a comparable basis. Meanwhile, grocery revenues from continuing businesses are expected to be level with last year, with operating profit lower – despite benefiting from favourable currency translation. Overall, the effect of weaker sterling will contribute £85m to operating profit in this financial year, most of which arose in the first three quarters. But, by the same token, margins have been under pressure from the slump in sterling as the company sources the bulk of its clothing in Asia and pays for it in dollars. This morning, ABF said sterling’s weakness against the US dollar will continue to have an adverse transactional effect on Primark’s margin in the first half although a benefit from the euro’s strength is expected in the second half. At current exchange rates, ABF also expects the euro’s strength to benefit British Sugar’s margins next year. Other costs are rising, too. Net interest expense will be at a similar level to last year but financial expenses will be higher – reflecting the effect of last year’s fall in bond yields on the group defined benefit pension scheme. Still, shareholders can look forward to that improved our full year outlook, knowing that adjusted operating profit is even further ahead of last year. With analysts having initially forecast earnings growth of 18 per cent for the full year, that is some way ahead of the competition. Carillion, however, has decided it must change the recipe and the chefs. This morning, the struggling construction group has changed its management team, as it attempts a turnround after a massive threatened its future. Zafar Khan, the group’s finance director, has left with immediate effect, while its chief operating officer and managing directors for its services and construction arms will leave at the end of this month.

Their departures follow the exit of chief executive Richard Howson when the profit warning was announced over the summer. In their place, Emma Mercer – previously finance director for Carillion’s UK construction business – has taken over as group CFO, and Andy Jones – who currently leads Carillion’s Canadian business – will become chief operating officer. Carillion has also appointed Lee Watson as “chief transformation officer”, on secondment from consultants Ernst & Young.

The London-based company said in a trading update ahead of the release in November of its annual results that it expects to “report good growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share for the group for the full year.” Sales at Primark, the low-cost fashion chain, are expected to have climbed 20 per cent year-on-year on a comparable week basis. Excluding currency impacts, ABF forecast a 13 per cent rise in sales, driven by increased retail selling space and a 1 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, an important metric for retailers. ABF said Primark performed “particularly well” in the UK, its home market, where sales are estimated to rise 10 per cent, with its market-share in the clothing market increasing “significantly.” The company added that “favourable weather in the fourth quarter and the strength of our consumer offering resulted in markdowns at lower levels than normal.” Meanwhile, sales and profits at ABF’s large sugar division are expected to be “well ahead of last year on a comparable basis adjusting for Illovo’s change of year end in 2016.” Overall, the weak pound has been a mixed bag for ABF. Two-thirds of its operating profit is derived in foreign currency, leading to a full-year benefit of £85m. At the same time, euro strength has been beneficial for British Sugar’s margin. However, “sterling weakness against the US dollar has had an adverse transactional effect on Primark’s largely dollar denominated purchases this year.”"

FT Opening Quote, with commentary by Matthew Vincent, is your early Square Mile briefing. You can warns on sterling. FT Opening Quote, with commentary by Matthew Vincent, is your early Square Mile briefing. You can Tabloid newspapers helping each other out, a housebuilder reporting slowing sales, an insurer deciding political risk is too difficult to cover… After 2016, even the unlikeliest events do not seem that surprising any more. This is not terribly helpful when trying to grab attention in an early morning email, but let’s take a closer look anyway. Newspaper publisher Trinity Mirror has said like-for-like revenue – stripping out its acquisition of Local World – fell by 8 per cent in the 53 weeks to January 1. Publishing print revenue was down 10.7 per cent, due to ongoing “challenges in print advertising markets”. In an attempt to counter this rapid decline, Trinity Mirror had been co-operating with the Daily Mail, Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, Guardian Media Group and Telegraph Media Group to work on an industry-wide plan to pool newspaper ad sales. But, last week, Trinity pulled out of talks, a month after the Daily Mail also pulled out of the initiative. Separately, Trinity Mirror had also been in talks with the Express titles, owned by Richard Desmond, about creating a new company that could share backroom operations. This morning, however, it said nothing about these collaborations and instead identified four “key areas of strategic focus”: growing the digital audience and revenue, building new diversified revenue streams, protecting print brands, and seeking out strategic opportunities. And, with the Local World acquisition included, the picture looks better: adjusted operating profit was 25 per cent higher than a year earlier and cost savings came in at £25m – some £10m ahead of target. achieved the rare feat of being able to report slowing profits from housebuilding – but still increasing its pre-tax number by almost a quarter and beating consensus forecasts by a distance. That’s what tends to happen when your earnings growth in the previous period was 34 per cent. In the calendar year 2016, revenue rose 8 per cent to £3.1bn, but underlying profit before tax was up 23 per cent to £782.8m. Consensus forecasts were for a 19 per cent rise to £756m in 2016. Forward sales are up to £1.9bn, some 9 per cent better than this time last year. Nicholas Wrigley, group chairman, said: “The strength of the Group’s operating model is demonstrated by our ability to grow completion volumes by more than 60 per cent and investing c. £2.6bn of cash in land through this period while simultaneously returning over £1.0bn of excess capital to shareholders.” Hiscox recently placed its political risk insurance book into run-off, “in response to ongoing challenging conditions in the London market”. And it was particularly telling that – at around the same time – it felt quite able to model the effects of a cyber attack cutting power to 93m Americans, the stock market falling 16 per cent and a category five hurricane damaging 1.8m buildings around Miami. At least these events are predictable. Hiscox seems to know what it’s doing. This morning it announced a record pre-tax profit of £354.5m, an increase of 64 per cent, after gross written premiums rose 23.6 per cent boosted by currency effects. Bronek Masojada, chief executive, said: “”This is a good result, flattered by foreign exchange and boosted by a strong investment return. Our retail business has come of age, driving growth and profitability for the Group. This gives us options and, although there are uncertainties in both the insurance and political environments, we have the right people, footprint and financial power to adapt.” But Associated British Foods, owner of the clothing chain, has warned that the benefits of a weak pound would wear off later in the year. In a trading update on Monday, the food, retail and ingredients group kept its full year outlook unchanged, saying that it expects an “excellent” profit performance. But while the UK, which generates half of Primark’s sales, achieved a 2 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the first half of the year, like-for-like sales were flat across the group. ABF also warned that the weakness in the pound would weigh down on its margins in the second half as its currency hedges were carried out at less advantageous exchange rates in the period. Beyond the Square Mile Asian markets were down on Monday, with the region’s bourses failing to benefit from another set of record highs for Wall Street’s main equities gauges. Japan’s Topix was off 1.1 per cent, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng reversed early gains and was 0.3 per cent lower.

Having spent £220m to acquire Local World’s 83 regional titles in 2015, creating the UK’s largest newspaper group, this is the question literally no one is asking . . . mainly because What’s On In Stoke Newington is, according to , “a big piece of paper with ‘**** All’ written on it” (a tad unfair, if you ask this former resident). Were it real or widely read, however, one suspects Trinity Mirror boss Simon Fox might be interested — because Monday’s results showed how consolidating local titles can paper over big cracks in print advertising sales. Adding Local World’s regional titles enabled Trinity Mirror to boost its total revenues by 20 per cent, to £731m, despite like-for-like print ad sales falling 18 per cent. Buying local paper revenue streams also offset losses from last year’s failed national launch, New Day, and suggested the publisher had worked out what readers really want, rather than what they say they want. New Day closed when only 30,000 people seized it — despite research suggesting many more craved a positive, politically neutral tabloid. Local World’s titles, by contrast, are now full of “listicles” and “clickbait”, according to one disgruntled former employee of the Croydon Advertiser, clearly impervious to its history of sacrificing Pulitzers to the commercial imperative. Remarkably, given 46 local papers have shut down since 2015, all bar eight of Trinity Mirror’s 140-odd titles are still publishing — indicating a certain ruthless financial discipline. Cost savings in the year were £10m better than expected, at £25m, thanks to synergies from Local World, which helped the operating margin widen 80 basis points to 19.3 per cent. Restructuring cost 78 jobs but created 44 new ones. Cash generation was strong, too. A 50 per cent rise in net cash inflows helped cut net debt by £62m to £30m — only £10m more than before the Local World deal, despite pension and legal costs. This, analysts suggest, leaves the means for further consolidation, and 5 per cent increases to the annual dividend. But running a declining business for cash has about as much of a future as Mr Sayle’s listings mag. Consequently, Trinity Mirror’s early-stage talks with Richard Desmond’s Express newspapers — ostensibly over a minority stake and cost sharing — may be the real headline news. If Mr Fox is unable to do another transformational deal, he will need to boost his digital revenues by 15 per cent a year, and see no worsening in print trends, just to return to growth in the medium term. However, with Mr Desmond moving into property development, on the site of his old Westferry print plant, he may be more amenable to an Express tie-up. Some years back, What’s On In Westferry would not have been a thrilling read (trust this former worker). But Mr Fox might wish to peruse a copy now. ABF’s four-horse race Racing quadrigas — the chariots pulled by four horses in Hollywood epic Ben Hur — was a precarious sport, writes Kate Burgess. Health and safety wouldn’t allow it today — too often, charioteers fell off the back. But we do have the corporate equivalent of a quadriga in Associated British Foods: an awkward conglomerate harnessing such ill-matched brands as Primark, British Sugar, Twinings tea and Ovaltine. Market purists say it should trade at a discount, but ABF’s shares trade close to 22 times earnings forecast for 2017. Monday’s trading update explained why. ABF talked of “excellent” half-year progress. Primark sales continue to rise. So do revenues from Twinings. And British Sugar is finally coming good: 2017 operating profits will be £200m-plus, against £34m last year. Currency shifts are pushing Primark margins down, but ABF has sold off a couple of lossmakers and group profits at the half year will be up a tenth. Stereotypical conglomerates impose group-wide growth targets and starve ill-favoured businesses to feed more fashionable ones. Portfolio managers trade companies to maximise earnings. ABF bosses, in contrast, hold the reins lightly. That is counter-intuitive and unsettles stock market fashionistas. The shares have fallen a quarter in a year. But, unlike a quadriga, when ABF slows to take a corner, it is a good time to hitch a ride. Its charioteers have shown they can accelerate fast on the straight without falling off the back. Throw the book at them! Amid the outrage over the Waterstones bookstores that look like independent shops — as expressed in both the and the — it is hard to pick the more intriguing facet. Is it that it took customers two years to deem a pastel façade beyond the pale? Or that it is suddenly an issue now that Waterstones isn’t lossmaking? Or that both newspapers run online bookstores undercutting high-street retailers? ABF:"

In a trading update on Monday, the FTSE 100 conglomerate said that almost all the profit increase for 2017 would come in the first six months of its financial year, which ends on March 4. John Bason, finance director at the Weston family-controlled group, said: “The first half will be excellent with a very strong increase in profits.” ABF said, however, that the benefits of a weak pound for its food businesses, which include the Twinings and Ovaltine brands, would fade in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, less advantageous currency hedges on Primark’s purchases than in the first six months would lead to a bigger fall in profit margins at the chain in the second half. Discount clothing chain Primark, which buys most of its products in dollars but makes 55 per cent of its sales in the UK, has been hit by sterling’s fall since the UK voted to leave the EU. It has said it will not recoup the higher costs through price increases because it wants to keep the lowest prices on the high street. ABF said first-half sales at Primark would be 11 per cent higher at constant exchange rates than in the same period last year, and 21 per cent higher at actual rates, thanks also to new store openings in the UK, Europe and the US. Like-for-like sales in the UK were 2 per cent higher than last year but flat across the whole Primark group, it added. ABF’s stock has fallen 22 per cent over the past 12 months on concerns about Primark’s sales growth. The shares were 1 per cent lower in early London trading at £25.90. Analysts at Barclays pointed to the recovery in ABF’s sugar business after a slump in commodities prices and said of Primark: “Against a generally uncertain retail backdrop, we believe the update offers reassurance.” Barclays forecasts a sixfold jump in sugar operating profits this year to £219m from £33m in 2016, and a 7 per cent fall in Primark’s profits to £643m. ABF has benefited from higher world sugar prices boosted by the sale of its lossmaking cane sugar business in southern China and efficiencies introduced at Illovo Sugar since taking full control of the South Africa-based sugar operation last year. The group has also become debt free and has net cash of £200m, due in part to the sale of the south China sugar operations and its US herbs and spices business. Mr Bason would not comment on reports that ABF had made a first round bid for Weetabix, the UK cereal maker being sold by China’s Bright Foods, but said dealmaking was most likely in its grocery and ingredients businesses. “There is no change to our M&A strategy but we’ve got the balance sheet to do it,” he said. Robert Waldschmidt, analyst at Liberum, said: “In full year 2017, we expect a strong rebound in group profits as sugar profits recover and Primark continues a strong store rollout programme.”"

In a trading update on Monday, the food, retail and ingredients conglomerate kept its full year outlook unchanged ahead of its interim results to be announced next week. ABF, which is controlled by the billionaire Weston family, said it expected “all” of its full-year rise in profits to be generated in the first six months of its financial year driven in part by the expansion of Primark and its overseas performance. Primark sales are set to climb 11 per cent from the same period last year when measured in constant currency and 21 per cent at actual exchange rates. The UK, which generates half of Primark’s sales, generated a 2 per cent rise in like for like sales in the first half of the year. But like for like sales were flat across the group. ABF also warned that the weakness in the pound would weigh down on its margins in the second half as its currency hedges were carried out at less advantageous exchange rates in the period. The retailer had warned of the pressures from the weak pound at the , but reported that sterling’s fall had given a boost to revenues in its grocery, ingredients and sugar businesses. Group sales rose 22 per cent — at constant exchange rates they were up 10 per cent in the 16 week period to January 7. The grocery business is expected to make further progress, ABF said today, with gains in market share for its Twinings drinks brand in the UK, Australia, France and the US. ABF shares have fallen 20 per cent over the last 12 months."

He is now expected to make an informal 408p per share cash offer for the business on his own. Mr Green and his advisers were on Monday night putting the finishing touches to legal documents in preparation for the launch of a revised GBP770m indicative offer by the businessman for Arcadia expected to be made as early as Monday. The proposed offer was previously conditional on Baugur buying three of Arcadia's businesses from Mr Green - Top Shop, Top Man and Miss Selfridge - once he had completed the acquisition of the group. Baugur holds a 20 per cent stake in Arcadia. But Baugur's participation in Mr Green's takeover approach was thrown into question last week after its Reykjavik headquarters were raided by police for alleged fraud. Merrill Lynch, Mr Green's advisers, have been locked up in talks with Baugur's lawyers, Allen &Overy, at the weekend to craft a separate agreement to Mr Green's proposed offer. The agreement would give Baugur first right of refusal to buy the three fashion brands from Mr Green after the takeover was concluded. Baugur, which denied that Mr Green had offered to buy its 20 per cent stake in Arcadia before making a formal bid for the business, on Sunday said it was still interested in acquiring the three Arcadia brands. Jon Asgeir Johannesson, Baugur's chairman, said: ""We are still working on this. There is no offer on the table yet from Mr Green. Baugur is still interested in those shops."" Baugur operates Debenhams, Top Shop and Miss Selfridge franchises in Iceland and Scandinavia. At a price of 408p, its 20 per cent stake would be worth GBP154.6m. Some analysts believe the three Arcadia brands it is seeking to acquire could be worth in excess of GBP200m. HBOS on Friday gave Mr Green the guarantee that it would provide the financing for his bid. The funds, however, will only be released once a bid is formally launched. Mr Green will be also be drawing on his own cash and family funds to finance the takeover. Tom Hunter, the Scottish retailer who owns a 5 per cent stake in Mr Green's clothes chain, BHS, is not thought to be participating directly in the financing of the proposed offer. However, Mr Hunter, may be awarded a small stake in an enlarged BHS/Arcadia entity. Mr Green and his advisers on Sunday declined to comment."

He said: ""I'm going to sit down with Merrill Lynch and decide what I'm going to do. Nothing has changed from last week."" Mr Green has limited time to manoeuvre. Arcadia's advisers are threatening to take their case to the Takeover Panel if Mr Green does not decide whether to raise his offer price soon. Mr Green and Stuart Rose, Arcadia's chief executive, have been airing their differences over the valuation of the retailer in public since mid-August, even as they exchange chatty phone calls in private. Mr Green has informally offered 365p; Mr Rose wants nothing less than 400p. Mr Green has won financial backing from Tom Hunter, the Scottish entrepreneur, and West LB, the German bank. Baugur, the Icelandic retail chain that owns 20 per cent of Arcadia, is believed to be interested in buying some of the group's assets if it is broken up following an acquisition. Mr Rose, however, has rallied the retailer's board behind the view that Mr Green's bid is too low. ""At the right number, we're prepared to accept a bid,"" said one Arcadia adviser.

Rupert Soames, chief executive chairman, said the group had performed ""out of its socks"" in the first quarter. In a statement, Philip Rogerson, chairman, said the group believed profits would be ""materially ahead of current market expecations"". Analysts said they expected profits to rise about 15 per cent this year and 10 per cent in 2008. The group's share price, which has doubled since June 2006, rose a further 38lp, or 7l per cent, in early trading on Wednesday. Since the preliminary results in March, the international power projects business has been awarded a further 170MW of contracts including 100MW in Yemen. Contracts in East Africa have also been extended. As a result, the high utilisation levels - thought to be over 90 per cent - will continue in the second half of the year. ""At the prelims we said we would invest GBP150m on capital investment, we've increased that to GBP175m but as soon as the new kit hits the ground, it goes out on rent,"" said Mr Soames. Emma Ormond, analyst at Oriel Securities, said this would have a further benefit on margins because there would be no demobilisation costs. However, she questioned whether the current utilisation levels were sustainable because of the need for repairs. ""We can't continue to run at this rate long term, but we can run at a higher rate than before because of our increased scale,"" said Mr Soames. At the group's local power rental business, first quarter profits in the US were below last year as a result of the re-construction work after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, but operations in North America were ""making progress"" while the recovery in Europe ""has continued apace"". Nick Spoliar, analyst at Bridgewell Securities, said investors should focus on the underlying driver of the international power projects business - the increasing demand for power in the developing world. Mr Soames said he thought international power projects business would continue to grow. ""Developing countries power consumption is growing ahead of GDP growth, but the countries have underinvested in their power infrastructure,"" said Mr Soames.

Take Bilbao, for example, a down-at-heel Spanish city where the Guggenheim museum, opened in 1997, has become a huge tourist draw. In the UK, there has been a spate of new art galleries in the most unlikely of places, often funded through Lottery money: The Lowry in Salford, the Millennium galleries in Sheffield and the New Art Gallery in Walsall. In the north-east there are two obvious examples. In Gateshead there is The Baltic, formerly known as Baltic Flour Mills. In Middlesbrough, meanwhile, Mima (Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art) opened in January. In this gritty town, which still bears the scars of decades of industrial decline, the glass and steel structure of Mima - overlooking five acres of park - is a small symbol of hope. There are other changes afoot in the physical landscape of Middlesbrough. Quintain, for example, has started developing a GBP200m, 1m sq ft mixed-use scheme at Middlehaven, a 40-acre site by the docks. The project, masterplanned by architect Will Alsop, includes 750 homes. Terrace Hill, another developer, is also developing a 30,700 sq ft office building at Middlehaven and has secured the Crown Prosecution Service as a tenant. The town lies within the wider Tees Valley, where a regeneration company was set up in 2002 to spearhead the redevelopment of the area. Its other projects include Central Park in Darlington, which will have 600 homes, offices and leisure facilities. Also under the auspices of Tees Valley Regeneration are plans for a new GBP15m bridge in Stockton which will be illuminated at night. The rebirth of a region's post-industrial landscape does not always happen quickly and some towns and suburbs are still crying out for improvements. Further up the east coast in Newcastle, centre of the biggest conurbation in the area, there are some areas - such as the bottom of Pilgrim Street - which remain boarded up. Even here, however, Australian group Multiplex has plans for a mixed-use development scheme. Other parts of Newcastle have already seen a genuine renaissance in recent years. The most-cited example is Newcastle Quayside, where the former Tyne and Wear Development Corporation pushed through riverside redevelopment. Trinity Gardens, within Quayside, is a more recent successful scheme with office space and new restaurants. There, occupiers are paying rents of GBP22 per sq ft, more than double the GBP10 which was the norm 10 years ago. Facing Newcastle Quayside are various new developments, including the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, the Sage Gateshead - a bubble-like music centre that was designed by Lord Foster. And the new Millennium Bridge links both sides of the river Tyne. ""The original success of the Quayside has created an amazing ripple effect,"" says Tim Evans, partner for agents Knight Frank in Newcastle, who calls it one of the finest waterfronts in Europe. Among other schemes taking place in the area is the GBP300m Baltic Business Quarter, by developer Terrace Hill, which will include the new premises of Gateshead College. Also on the south side is Baltic Place, a 130,000 sq ft scheme being developed by City &Northern. The amount of office space available to let on Tyneside has fallen to its lowest levels for more than 20 years, at about 5.5 per cent - down from 8.2 per cent in 2002. This is likely to spur the development of more office schemes. Ian Parker, head of GVA Grimley for Newcastle, says there is only about 60,000 sq ft of available ""Grade A"" space in the city. ""If you look at the pipeline, that isn't going to change in the next 12 months. There is very little available space,"" he says. Developers have been able to take advantage of public grants administered by the European Regional Development Fund and others but these are finite. ""Many areas in the region will lose grant assistance following the current review of assisted areas,"" says Mark Proudlock, an industrial partner at Knight Frank. Several business parks and logistics centres have been built in the north-east in recent years, including Cobalt Park, built by Highbridge, which has let more than 350,000 sq ft in the last year to the likes of EDS, GE Money and Northumbria Healthcare Trust. The other big business park in Tyneside, Quorum, developed by Grantax, has let space to IBM, National Grid and others. Both of these have benefited from enterprise zone status. Progress has been less speedy at Great North Park, where there are plans for vast areas of business units and homes; so far the park is occupied only by Sage, although several hundred houses have been built. Meanwhile Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has announced plans for a 200,000 sq ft logistics facility in Washington. And in Sunderland, Goodman - the Australian property group which recently bought Akeler - is developing 400,000 sq ft of new offices for Northern Rock at a new 800,000 sq ft business park called Rainton Bridge. This is not far from another of Goodman's complexes, the 1.25m sq ft Doxford International Business Park. Patrick Going, development director at Goodman, says the group is deliberately targeting large multinational companies as well as smaller firms. ""This is our testament to the confidence we have in the region as a top-class business location,"" he says. 58641910"

Tales of ruthless collection techniques and of heavily indebted borrowers being driven to prostitution and suicide have portrayed the entire industry as little better than a collection of loan sharks, despite widely varying standards among the estimated 12,000 companies in the Y24,000bn market. The plight of an estimated 2m to 3m borrowers with debts to several consumer finance companies drew particular attention last year, prompting the government to implement changes to the moneylending business to prevent the kind of excessive borrowing that resulted in personal bankruptcy and other tragedies. But the solution the government settled on is leading to a shake-out of the industry and a growing credit crunch that could end up harming the many low-income borrowers the reforms are intended to help. The revised moneylending law, which comes into effect at the end of 2009, will lower the maximum interest rate from 29.2 per cent to 20 per cent and limit borrowings to one-third of annual income. At the same time, the industry has been dealt a double blow by a Supreme Court ruling that has effectively invalidated interest rates of above 20 per cent on loans outstanding. This had led to mounting claims from borrowers demanding that lenders repay the excess interest with 5 per cent interest added on. As a result of growing interest repayment claims and the new legislation, Japan's consumer finance industry - which is comprised of some large companies and thousands of very small lenders - is expected to shrink by as much as a third, according to some estimates. The changes were enough to lead even the largest consumer finance companies to adopt wide-ranging restructuring measures to cut costs, and have forced weaker players to cut back their operations massively if not close their doors or seek survival in a merger with a stronger rival. In the latest move, Sanyo Shinpan, the seventh largest consumer finance group, sought refuge in the arms of Promise, one of the largest in the industry and an affiliate of mega-bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, which owns 20 per cent. Meanwhile, GE is considering selling its Japanese consumer finance unit, Lake. In addition to the regulatory and legal challenges, consumer finance companies face rising interest rates, which will hit their profitability. ""At short-term rates of 2 per cent, consumer finance companies will not be able to survive. At the moment, they are being saved to a large extent by the Bank of Japan's slow pace of rate increases,"" says a senior banker. Meanwhile, amid the market turmoil, Japan's large banks are looking to take a larger slice of the market through their consumer finance and credit card affiliates. ""Banks will enter this market aggressively through their credit card businesses,"" says a senior banker at one of the mega-banks. The most lucrative part of the credit card business is consumer loans, which have interest rates of up to 20 per cent. Japan's large banks, which were not particularly focused on retail lending until recently, have started to build up their consumer lending businesses amid weak loan demand from the corporate sector. SMFG, which has significant stakes in five credit card and consumer finance companies, has declared its intention to become Japan's number one credit card group. Mizuho, which bailed out its consumer finance affiliate, Orient Corporation, with a Y288bn financial package, is also keen to expand its credit card business. Although banks lack the credit expertise that consumer finance companies have built up over the years, they are better placed to make profits at the lower interest rates of between 5 per cent and 12 per cent, which they charge, due to their lower funding costs. ""If consumer finance companies have to compete in the same market, they will be at a disadvantage because people will prefer banks,"" says Shinichi Ina, banking analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. Shinichi Tamura, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo, forecasts that in the near future, three of the top five credit card and consumer finance groups will be part of a mega-bank. The question is whether there is such a large market for consumer loans at interest rates of 20 per cent and below. Some analysts believe that people in this credit segment, who tend not to borrow, other than for mortgages, will not change their behaviour. Meanwhile, the increasing participation of the banks in the non-collateralised consumer lending business will not help the millions of people whose credit ratings are too low to borrow at legal rates. In a bid to lower their default rates, consumer finance companies are already turning away up to 70 per cent of borrowers. The number of bankruptcies among proprietor-owned businesses - which often rely on consumer finance companies for short-term emergency operating funds - has risen steadily since last September and more than doubled year-on-year in June this year, to 162, according to Teikoku Data Bank. The growing reluctance of consumer finance companies to lend to people with low credit ratings will force many would-be borrowers into the hands of loan sharks, says Kenshi Nishida, a lawyer who helps heavily indebted borrowers claim excess interest repayment from consumer finance companies. ""Unless there is a [police] clampdown, loan sharks will resurface,"" he says. 58640186"

After years of vehemently pledging allegiance to its credit card business, the retailer will now consider selling its $7bn of credit card receivables. The operation has proved highly lucrative. But it may finally be time to free up capital for other uses. Target has boosted its profits for years by clinging to its strongly performing financing arm even as most other big retailers sold theirs. But with its customers and cardholders facing mortgage resets, tighter credit and a slowing economy - and with Bill Ackman, the activist fund manager, banging on its door - Target is finding it tougher to stick to its contrarian credit card position. Several institutions, including Citigroup, HSBC, JPMorgan and GE Capital have consolidated a large share of the credit card market and might take eager looks at the assets. Target has probably surrendered some leverage by holding on to the business after the credit market peaked. But in spite of tougher conditions, it is not clear Target would have to take a substantial haircut on any proceeds. A sale is certainly beguiling. Target has been trounced by Wal-Mart in the food segment, where it is trying to gain traction. Cash from a deal could help build an infrastructure for perishable food sales, which generate plenty of store traffic - and, unlike credit card receivables, carry no default risk. Admittedly, the company is not capital constrained. But selling the card business would allow it to invest further in retail while also yielding to Mr Ackman's desire for accelerated share buybacks. Given its impassioned arguments in favour of the business, Target could use this review to reaffirm its commitment to credit cards. But while the portfolio's creditworthiness has not diminished, fears over consumer spending are building. This may be Target's best near-term chance to refocus on its retail skills and cash out by selling to a buyer with financial scale. 58641899"

The group which rents power generation sets to customers in 90 countries said on Thursday that it expected full year profits to be ""well ahead of market expectations"". Analysts rushed to increase their forecasts for 2007 from around GBP110m to GBP120m, and for 2008 from around GBP116m to GBP130m. In 2006 the group made a pre-tax profit of GBP83.1m, before exceptional charges. In lunchtime trading the shares were up 3p at 553p. Rupert Soames, chief executive, said while power stations can take 5 to 10 years to plan and build, Aggreko can supply power generators in 5 to 10 weeks. Many developing countries were enjoying high rates of economic growth and power demand generally rose faster than GDP, he said. The shortage of generating capacity was ""not a flash in the pan,"" he said, but a structural deficit that was growing wider. Aggreko now supplies half the national grid electricity of Uganda; supplied over 35 megawatts of power to the Glastonbury music festival and has won a contract to supply power and temperature control equipment to the Beijing Olympics. The strong level of demand meant that capacity utilisation in the international power business was running at over 90 per cent, and the group was increasing its capital spending to build more capacity. Capex will rise to GBP185m for the year, from GBP128m in 2006, and would run at twice the rate of depreciation, Mr Soames said. The group builds its portable power stations in Dumbarton, Scotland, and airlifts or ships them around the world. Mr Soames said the group's advantage was the ability to shift its rental fleet to meet demand, so that if there was a cooling in one territory it could move capacity to another. He said the group was watching its business in North America carefully for any signs of weakening demand, but as yet had seen none, and less than 1 per cent of group revenues were made from the US construction industry. Group revenues rose 33.4 per cent in the half year to June to GBP317.5m, with high capacity utilisation rates boosting profit margins. The figures also benefited from the inclusion of the GE energy rental business bought in December. Mr Soames said the purchase had exceeded expectations, and Aggreko now expected the GE business to contribute in its first year the profits that it had expected in its second year. Trading profits from the international power projects division more than doubled from GBP10.4m to GBP24m, and showed a 155.2 per cent increase in dollar terms, while those from its ""local"" businesses, which range around the world, rose 32.4 per cent to GBP26.9m. Earnings per share rose 63 per cent to 11.64p and the interim dividend is up 20 per cent to 3.04p. 58618908"

With earnings expectations cut three times in recent months and the shares down almost a fifth from their June high, is it time to say the same for Smiths Group? Since its aerospace division was sold to General Electric this year, the logic for maintaining the status quo has looked increasingly tenuous. Aside from the decent price tag, the reason for the sale was Smiths' lack of scale. The same argument might equally apply to its medical equipment arm. This should be an attractive area as western populations age, but organic profit growth has been lacklustre. As corporate America finally starts to tackle rising healthcare liabilities, prompting downward pressure on pricing, the danger is that the division gets squeezed in its largest market. The John Crane unit, which sells industrial seals, needs attention too. Performance has been respectable but lacks the pep of peers also benefiting from the capital spending boom in the oil and gas industry. One of the historical advantages of Smiths has been its ability to generate cash flow, but what both businesses now need is more investment - for research and development in the medical business and to improve profitability at John Crane. However, the programme to cut central costs and integrate the joint venture in detection with GE will put further demands on bosses' time. Assuming trade buyers can be found for the individual parts, a break-up valuation in the region of GBP12 a share would be reasonable. By selling the trophy asset, aerospace, Smiths' management has already shown an open mind. With Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the long-standing chief executive, due to step down next year, a break-up could be a parting gift to shareholders. 58632341"
